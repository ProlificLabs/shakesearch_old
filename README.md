# ShakeSearch Challenge

Welcome to the Pulley Shakesearch Challenge! This repository contains a simple web app for searching text in the complete works of Shakespeare.

## Prerequisites

To run the tests, you need to have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your system.

## Your Task

Your task is to fix the underlying code to make the failing tests in the app pass. There are 3 frontend tests and 3 backend tests, with 2 of each currently failing. You should not modify the tests themselves, but rather improve the code to meet the test requirements. You can use the provided Dockerfile to run the tests or the app locally. The success criteria are to have all 6 tests passing.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Turn on Github Actions (click Actions tab in Github and press "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them", free for public repos)
3. Fix the underlying code to make the tests pass
5. Include a short explanation of your changes in the readme or changelog file.
6. Email us back with a link to your fork.

## Running the App Locally


This command runs the app on your machine and will be available in browser at localhost:3001.

```bash
make run
```

## Running the Tests

This command runs backend and frontend tests.

Backend testing directly runs all Go tests.

Frontend testing run the app and mochajs tests inside docker, using internal port 3002.

```bash
make test
```

Good luck!
