# ShakeSearch Front End Prompt

Welcome to the Pulley Shakesearch Take-home Challenge! In this repository,
you'll find a simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in
the complete works of Shakespeare.

You can see a live version of the app at
https://pulley-shakesearch.herokuapp.com/. Try searching for "Hamlet" to display
a set of results.

In it's current state, however, the app is just a rough prototype. The search is
case sensitive, the results are difficult to read, and the search is limited to
exact matches.
