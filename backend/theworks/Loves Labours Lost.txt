Loves Labours Lost 

ACT I
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.

    Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN 

FERDINAND

    Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
    Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
    And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
    The endeavor of this present breath may buy
    That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
    And make us heirs of all eternity.
    Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
    That war against your own affections
    And the huge army of the world's desires,--
    Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
    Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
    Our court shall be a little Academe,
    Still and contemplative in living art.
    You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
    Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
    My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
    That are recorded in this schedule here:
    Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
    That his own hand may strike his honour down
    That violates the smallest branch herein:
    If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
    Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE

    I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
    The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
    Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
    Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN

    My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
    The grosser manner of these world's delights
    He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
    To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
    With all these living in philosophy.

BIRON

    I can but say their protestation over;
    So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
    That is, to live and study here three years.
    But there are other strict observances;
    As, not to see a woman in that term,
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
    And one day in a week to touch no food
    And but one meal on every day beside,
    The which I hope is not enrolled there;
    And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
    And not be seen to wink of all the day--
    When I was wont to think no harm all night
    And make a dark night too of half the day--
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
    O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
    Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

FERDINAND

    Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BIRON

    Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
    I only swore to study with your grace
    And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE

    You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.

BIRON

    By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
    What is the end of study? let me know.

FERDINAND

    Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

BIRON

    Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

FERDINAND

    Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.

BIRON

    Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
    To know the thing I am forbid to know:
    As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
    When I to feast expressly am forbid;
    Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
    When mistresses from common sense are hid;
    Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
    Study to break it and not break my troth.
    If study's gain be thus and this be so,
    Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
    Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

FERDINAND

    These be the stops that hinder study quite
    And train our intellects to vain delight.

BIRON

    Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
    Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
    As, painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
    Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
    So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
    Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
    Study me how to please the eye indeed
    By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
    And give him light that it was blinded by.
    Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
    That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
    Small have continual plodders ever won
    Save base authority from others' books
    These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
    That give a name to every fixed star
    Have no more profit of their shining nights
    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
    Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
    And every godfather can give a name.

FERDINAND

    How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN

    Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE

    He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.

BIRON

    The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN

    How follows that?

BIRON

    Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN

    In reason nothing.

BIRON

    Something then in rhyme.

FERDINAND

    Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
    That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BIRON

    Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
    Before the birds have any cause to sing?
    Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
    At Christmas I no more desire a rose
    Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
    But like of each thing that in season grows.
    So you, to study now it is too late,
    Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

FERDINAND

    Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.

BIRON

    No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
    And though I have for barbarism spoke more
    Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
    Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
    And bide the penance of each three years' day.
    Give me the paper; let me read the same;
    And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

FERDINAND

    How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BIRON

    [Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
    mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?

LONGAVILLE

    Four days ago.

BIRON

    Let's see the penalty.

    Reads
    'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?

LONGAVILLE

    Marry, that did I.

BIRON

    Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE

    To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BIRON

    A dangerous law against gentility!

    Reads
    'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
    within the term of three years, he shall endure such
    public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
    This article, my liege, yourself must break;
    For well you know here comes in embassy
    The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
    A maid of grace and complete majesty--
    About surrender up of Aquitaine
    To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
    Therefore this article is made in vain,
    Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

FERDINAND

    What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BIRON

    So study evermore is overshot:
    While it doth study to have what it would
    It doth forget to do the thing it should,
    And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
    'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

FERDINAND

    We must of force dispense with this decree;
    She must lie here on mere necessity.

BIRON

    Necessity will make us all forsworn
    Three thousand times within this three years' space;
    For every man with his affects is born,
    Not by might master'd but by special grace:
    If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
    I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
    So to the laws at large I write my name:

    Subscribes
    And he that breaks them in the least degree
    Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
    Suggestions are to other as to me;
    But I believe, although I seem so loath,
    I am the last that will last keep his oath.
    But is there no quick recreation granted?

FERDINAND

    Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
    With a refined traveller of Spain;
    A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
    That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
    One whom the music of his own vain tongue
    Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
    A man of complements, whom right and wrong
    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
    For interim to our studies shall relate
    In high-born words the worth of many a knight
    From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
    How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
    But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
    And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BIRON

    Armado is a most illustrious wight,
    A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE

    Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
    And so to study, three years is but short.

    Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD

DULL

    Which is the duke's own person?

BIRON

    This, fellow: what wouldst?

DULL

    I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
    grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
    in flesh and blood.

BIRON

    This is he.

DULL

    Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
    abroad: this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD

    Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

FERDINAND

    A letter from the magnificent Armado.

BIRON

    How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE

    A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!

BIRON

    To hear? or forbear laughing?

LONGAVILLE

    To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
    forbear both.

BIRON

    Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
    climb in the merriness.

COSTARD

    The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BIRON

    In what manner?

COSTARD

    In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
    I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
    her upon the form, and taken following her into the
    park; which, put together, is in manner and form
    following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
    manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
    in some form.

BIRON

    For the following, sir?

COSTARD

    As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
    the right!

FERDINAND

    Will you hear this letter with attention?

BIRON

    As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD

    Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
    sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
    and body's fostering patron.'

COSTARD

    Not a word of Costard yet.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'So it is,'--

COSTARD

    It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
    telling true, but so.

FERDINAND

    Peace!

COSTARD

    Be to me and every man that dares not fight!

FERDINAND

    No words!

COSTARD

    Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
    melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
    to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
    air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
    walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
    beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
    to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
    for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
    I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
    for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
    that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
    from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
    here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
    but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
    and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
    knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
    swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--

COSTARD

    Me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--

COSTARD

    Me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--

COSTARD

    Still me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--

COSTARD

    O, me!

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
    established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
    which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
    wherewith,--

COSTARD

    With a wench.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
    female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
    woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
    have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
    punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
    Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
    estimation.'

DULL

    'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
    called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
    swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
    and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
    her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
    and heart-burning heat of duty.
    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

BIRON

    This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
    that ever I heard.

FERDINAND

    Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
    you to this?

COSTARD

    Sir, I confess the wench.

FERDINAND

    Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD

    I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
    the marking of it.

FERDINAND

    It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
    with a wench.

COSTARD

    I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.

FERDINAND

    Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'

COSTARD

    This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.

FERDINAND

    It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'

COSTARD

    If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.

FERDINAND

    This maid will not serve your turn, sir.

COSTARD

    This maid will serve my turn, sir.

FERDINAND

    Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
    a week with bran and water.

COSTARD

    I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

FERDINAND

    And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
    My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
    And go we, lords, to put in practise that
    Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

    Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN

BIRON

    I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
    These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
    Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD

    I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
    taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
    girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
    prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
    till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

    Exeunt
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH 

    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
    grows melancholy?

MOTH

    A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH

    No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
    tender juvenal?

MOTH

    By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Why tough senior? why tough senior?

MOTH

    Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
    appertaining to thy young days, which we may
    nominate tender.

MOTH

    And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
    old time, which we may name tough.
    DON ADRIANO DE

ARMADO

    Pretty and apt.

MOTH

    How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
    I apt, and my saying pretty?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH

    Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH

    Speak you this in my praise, master?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    In thy condign praise.

MOTH

    I will praise an eel with the same praise.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What, that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH

    That an eel is quick.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

MOTH

    I am answered, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I love not to be crossed.

MOTH

    [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I have promised to study three years with the duke.

MOTH

    You may do it in an hour, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Impossible.

MOTH

    How many is one thrice told?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH

    You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
    complete man.

MOTH

    Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
    deuce-ace amounts to.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH

    Which the base vulgar do call three.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    True.

MOTH

    Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
    is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
    easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
    study three years in two words, the dancing horse
    will tell you.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    A most fine figure!

MOTH

    To prove you a cipher.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
    base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
    base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
    of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
    thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
    ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
    courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
    outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
    have been in love?

MOTH

    Hercules, master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
    more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
    repute and carriage.

MOTH

    Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
    carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
    like a porter: and he was in love.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
    excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
    carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
    love, my dear Moth?

MOTH

    A woman, master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Of what complexion?

MOTH

    Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH

    Of the sea-water green, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH

    As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
    love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
    for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH

    It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH

    Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
    such colours.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH

    My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
    pathetical!

MOTH

    If she be made of white and red,
    Her faults will ne'er be known,
    For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
    And fears by pale white shown:
    Then if she fear, or be to blame,
    By this you shall not know,
    For still her cheeks possess the same
    Which native she doth owe.
    A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
    white and red.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH

    The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
    three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
    found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
    the writing nor the tune.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
    example my digression by some mighty precedent.
    Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
    park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

MOTH

    [Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
    my master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH

    And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I say, sing.

MOTH

    Forbear till this company be past.

    Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA

DULL

    Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
    safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
    nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
    For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
    is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

JAQUENETTA

    Man?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will visit thee at the lodge.

JAQUENETTA

    That's hereby.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I know where it is situate.

JAQUENETTA

    Lord, how wise you are!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will tell thee wonders.

JAQUENETTA

    With that face?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I love thee.

JAQUENETTA

    So I heard you say.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    And so, farewell.

JAQUENETTA

    Fair weather after you!

DULL

    Come, Jaquenetta, away!

    Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
    be pardoned.

COSTARD

    Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
    full stomach.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD

    I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
    are but lightly rewarded.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Take away this villain; shut him up.

MOTH

    Come, you transgressing slave; away!

COSTARD

    Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

MOTH

    No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.

COSTARD

    Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
    that I have seen, some shall see.

MOTH

    What shall some see?

COSTARD

    Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
    It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
    words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
    God I have as little patience as another man; and
    therefore I can be quiet.

    Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
    her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
    is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
    is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
    how can that be true love which is falsely
    attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
    there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
    tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
    Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
    Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
    and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
    The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
    the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
    not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
    glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
    be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
    he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
    for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
    write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT II
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants 

BOYET

    Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
    Consider who the king your father sends,
    To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
    Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
    To parley with the sole inheritor
    Of all perfections that a man may owe,
    Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
    Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
    Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
    As Nature was in making graces dear
    When she did starve the general world beside
    And prodigally gave them all to you.

PRINCESS

    Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
    Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
    Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
    Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
    I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
    Than you much willing to be counted wise
    In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
    But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
    You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
    Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
    Till painful study shall outwear three years,
    No woman may approach his silent court:
    Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
    To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
    Bold of your worthiness, we single you
    As our best-moving fair solicitor.
    Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
    On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
    Importunes personal conference with his grace:
    Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
    Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

BOYET

    Proud of employment, willingly I go.

PRINCESS

    All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

    Exit BOYET
    Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
    That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

First Lord

    Lord Longaville is one.

PRINCESS

    Know you the man?

MARIA

    I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
    Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
    Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
    In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
    A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
    Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
    Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
    If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
    Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
    Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
    It should none spare that come within his power.

PRINCESS

    Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

MARIA

    They say so most that most his humours know.

PRINCESS

    Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
    Who are the rest?

KATHARINE

    The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
    Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
    Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
    For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
    And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
    I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
    And much too little of that good I saw
    Is my report to his great worthiness.

ROSALINE

    Another of these students at that time
    Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
    Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
    Within the limit of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal:
    His eye begets occasion for his wit;
    For every object that the one doth catch
    The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
    Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
    Delivers in such apt and gracious words
    That aged ears play truant at his tales
    And younger hearings are quite ravished;
    So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

PRINCESS

    God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
    That every one her own hath garnished
    With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

First Lord

    Here comes Boyet.

    Re-enter BOYET

PRINCESS

    Now, what admittance, lord?

BOYET

    Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
    And he and his competitors in oath
    Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
    Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,
    Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
    Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
    To let you enter his unpeopled house.
    Here comes Navarre.

    Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants

FERDINAND

    Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

PRINCESS

    'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
    not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
    yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

FERDINAND

    You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

PRINCESS

    I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

FERDINAND

    Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

PRINCESS

    Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

FERDINAND

    Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

PRINCESS

    Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

FERDINAND

    Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

PRINCESS

    Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
    Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
    I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
    Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
    And sin to break it.
    But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
    To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
    Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
    And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

FERDINAND

    Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

PRINCESS

    You will the sooner, that I were away;
    For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

BIRON

    Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

ROSALINE

    Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BIRON

    I know you did.

ROSALINE

    How needless was it then to ask the question!

BIRON

    You must not be so quick.

ROSALINE

    'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

BIRON

    Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

ROSALINE

    Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

BIRON

    What time o' day?

ROSALINE

    The hour that fools should ask.

BIRON

    Now fair befall your mask!

ROSALINE

    Fair fall the face it covers!

BIRON

    And send you many lovers!

ROSALINE

    Amen, so you be none.

BIRON

    Nay, then will I be gone.

FERDINAND

    Madam, your father here doth intimate
    The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
    Being but the one half of an entire sum
    Disbursed by my father in his wars.
    But say that he or we, as neither have,
    Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
    A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
    One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
    Although not valued to the money's worth.
    If then the king your father will restore
    But that one half which is unsatisfied,
    We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
    And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
    But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
    For here he doth demand to have repaid
    A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
    On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
    To have his title live in Aquitaine;
    Which we much rather had depart withal
    And have the money by our father lent
    Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
    Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
    From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
    A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
    And go well satisfied to France again.

PRINCESS

    You do the king my father too much wrong
    And wrong the reputation of your name,
    In so unseeming to confess receipt
    Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

FERDINAND

    I do protest I never heard of it;
    And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
    Or yield up Aquitaine.

PRINCESS

    We arrest your word.
    Boyet, you can produce acquittances
    For such a sum from special officers
    Of Charles his father.

FERDINAND

    Satisfy me so.

BOYET

    So please your grace, the packet is not come
    Where that and other specialties are bound:
    To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

FERDINAND

    It shall suffice me: at which interview
    All liberal reason I will yield unto.
    Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
    As honour without breach of honour may
    Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
    You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
    But here without you shall be so received
    As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
    Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
    Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
    To-morrow shall we visit you again.

PRINCESS

    Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

FERDINAND

    Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

    Exit

BIRON

    Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

ROSALINE

    Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.

BIRON

    I would you heard it groan.

ROSALINE

    Is the fool sick?

BIRON

    Sick at the heart.

ROSALINE

    Alack, let it blood.

BIRON

    Would that do it good?

ROSALINE

    My physic says 'ay.'

BIRON

    Will you prick't with your eye?

ROSALINE

    No point, with my knife.

BIRON

    Now, God save thy life!

ROSALINE

    And yours from long living!

BIRON

    I cannot stay thanksgiving.

    Retiring

DUMAIN

    Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET

    The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN

    A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.

    Exit

LONGAVILLE

    I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

BOYET

    A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

LONGAVILLE

    Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

BOYET

    She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

LONGAVILLE

    Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

BOYET

    Her mother's, I have heard.

LONGAVILLE

    God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET

    Good sir, be not offended.
    She is an heir of Falconbridge.

LONGAVILLE

    Nay, my choler is ended.
    She is a most sweet lady.

BOYET

    Not unlike, sir, that may be.

    Exit LONGAVILLE

BIRON

    What's her name in the cap?

BOYET

    Rosaline, by good hap.

BIRON

    Is she wedded or no?

BOYET

    To her will, sir, or so.

BIRON

    You are welcome, sir: adieu.

BOYET

    Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

    Exit BIRON

MARIA

    That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
    Not a word with him but a jest.

BOYET

    And every jest but a word.

PRINCESS

    It was well done of you to take him at his word.

BOYET

    I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

MARIA

    Two hot sheeps, marry.

BOYET

    And wherefore not ships?
    No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

MARIA

    You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

BOYET

    So you grant pasture for me.

    Offering to kiss her

MARIA

    Not so, gentle beast:
    My lips are no common, though several they be.

BOYET

    Belonging to whom?

MARIA

    To my fortunes and me.

PRINCESS

    Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
    This civil war of wits were much better used
    On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

BOYET

    If my observation, which very seldom lies,
    By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
    Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

PRINCESS

    With what?

BOYET

    With that which we lovers entitle affected.

PRINCESS

    Your reason?

BOYET

    Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
    To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
    His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
    Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
    His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
    Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
    All senses to that sense did make their repair,
    To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
    Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
    As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
    Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
    Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
    His face's own margent did quote such amazes
    That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
    I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
    An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

PRINCESS

    Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.

BOYET

    But to speak that in words which his eye hath
    disclosed.
    I only have made a mouth of his eye,
    By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

ROSALINE

    Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

MARIA

    He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.

ROSALINE

    Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

BOYET

    Do you hear, my mad wenches?

MARIA

    No.

BOYET

    What then, do you see?

ROSALINE

    Ay, our way to be gone.

BOYET

    You are too hard for me.

    Exeunt
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT III
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH 

    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

MOTH

    Concolinel.

    Singing
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
    give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
    hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH

    Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How meanest thou? brawling in French?

MOTH

    No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
    the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
    it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
    sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
    swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
    the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
    love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
    your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
    doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
    your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
    keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
    These are complements, these are humours; these
    betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
    these; and make them men of note--do you note
    me?--that most are affected to these.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH

    By my penny of observation.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    But O,--but O,--

MOTH

    'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH

    No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
    love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Almost I had.

MOTH

    Negligent student! learn her by heart.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH

    And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What wilt thou prove?

MOTH

    A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
    the instant: by heart you love her, because your
    heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
    because your heart is in love with her; and out of
    heart you love her, being out of heart that you
    cannot enjoy her.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I am all these three.

MOTH

    And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
    all.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.

MOTH

    A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
    for an ass.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

MOTH

    Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
    for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The way is but short: away!

MOTH

    As swift as lead, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The meaning, pretty ingenious?
    Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH

    Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I say lead is slow.

MOTH

    You are too swift, sir, to say so:
    Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
    He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
    I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH

    Thump then and I flee.

    Exit
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
    By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
    Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
    My herald is return'd.

    Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD

MOTH

    A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD

    No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
    mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
    l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
    thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
    me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
    Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
    the word l'envoy for a salve?

MOTH

    Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
    Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
    I will example it:
    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.
    There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH

    I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.

MOTH

    Until the goose came out of door,
    And stay'd the odds by adding four.
    Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
    my l'envoy.
    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Until the goose came out of door,
    Staying the odds by adding four.

MOTH

    A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
    desire more?

COSTARD

    The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
    Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
    To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
    Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH

    By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
    Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD

    True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
    argument in;
    Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
    And he ended the market.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH

    I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD

    Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
    I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
    Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD

    Till there be more matter in the shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD

    O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
    some goose, in this.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
    enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
    restrained, captivated, bound.

COSTARD

    True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
    in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
    bear this significant

    Giving a letter
    to the country maid Jaquenetta:
    there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
    honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

    Exit

MOTH

    Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

COSTARD

    My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!

    Exit MOTH
    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
    O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
    farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
    inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
    remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
    why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
    never buy and sell out of this word.

    Enter BIRON

BIRON

    O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.

COSTARD

    Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
    buy for a remuneration?

BIRON

    What is a remuneration?

COSTARD

    Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BIRON

    Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD

    I thank your worship: God be wi' you!

BIRON

    Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
    As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
    Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD

    When would you have it done, sir?

BIRON

    This afternoon.

COSTARD

    Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.

BIRON

    Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD

    I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BIRON

    Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD

    I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

BIRON

    It must be done this afternoon.
    Hark, slave, it is but this:
    The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
    And in her train there is a gentle lady;
    When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
    And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
    And to her white hand see thou do commend
    This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

    Giving him a shilling

COSTARD

    Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
    a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
    will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

    Exit

BIRON

    And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
    A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
    A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
    A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
    Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
    This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
    This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
    Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
    The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
    Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
    Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
    Sole imperator and great general
    Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
    And I to be a corporal of his field,
    And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
    What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
    A woman, that is like a German clock,
    Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
    And never going aright, being a watch,
    But being watch'd that it may still go right!
    Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
    And, among three, to love the worst of all;
    A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
    With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
    Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
    Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
    And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
    To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
    That Cupid will impose for my neglect
    Of his almighty dreadful little might.
    Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
    Some men must love my lady and some Joan.

ACT IV
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE 

PRINCESS

    Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
    Against the steep uprising of the hill?

BOYET

    I know not; but I think it was not he.

PRINCESS

    Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
    Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
    On Saturday we will return to France.
    Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
    That we must stand and play the murderer in?

Forester

    Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
    A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.

PRINCESS

    I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
    And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

Forester

    Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.

PRINCESS

    What, what? first praise me and again say no?
    O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!

Forester

    Yes, madam, fair.

PRINCESS

    Nay, never paint me now:
    Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
    Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
    Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

Forester

    Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.

PRINCESS

    See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
    O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
    A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
    But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
    And shooting well is then accounted ill.
    Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
    Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
    If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
    That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
    And out of question so it is sometimes,
    Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
    When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
    We bend to that the working of the heart;
    As I for praise alone now seek to spill
    The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.

BOYET

    Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
    Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
    Lords o'er their lords?

PRINCESS

    Only for praise: and praise we may afford
    To any lady that subdues a lord.

BOYET

    Here comes a member of the commonwealth.

    Enter COSTARD

COSTARD

    God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?

PRINCESS

    Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.

COSTARD

    Which is the greatest lady, the highest?

PRINCESS

    The thickest and the tallest.

COSTARD

    The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
    An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
    One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
    Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.

PRINCESS

    What's your will, sir? what's your will?

COSTARD

    I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.

PRINCESS

    O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
    Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
    Break up this capon.

BOYET

    I am bound to serve.
    This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
    It is writ to Jaquenetta.

PRINCESS

    We will read it, I swear.
    Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.

    Reads

BOYET

    'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
    true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
    thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
    than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
    commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
    magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
    eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
    Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
    Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
    vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
    came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
    overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
    come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
    whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
    beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
    conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
    The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
    beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
    side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
    both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
    thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
    Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
    thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
    will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
    for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
    expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
    my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
    part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
    Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
    'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
    Submissive fall his princely feet before,
    And he from forage will incline to play:
    But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
    Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

PRINCESS

    What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
    What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?

BOYET

    I am much deceived but I remember the style.

PRINCESS

    Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

BOYET

    This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
    A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
    To the prince and his bookmates.

PRINCESS

    Thou fellow, a word:
    Who gave thee this letter?

COSTARD

    I told you; my lord.

PRINCESS

    To whom shouldst thou give it?

COSTARD

    From my lord to my lady.

PRINCESS

    From which lord to which lady?

COSTARD

    From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
    To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.

PRINCESS

    Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.

    To ROSALINE
    Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.

    Exeunt PRINCESS and train

BOYET

    Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

ROSALINE

    Shall I teach you to know?

BOYET

    Ay, my continent of beauty.

ROSALINE

    Why, she that bears the bow.
    Finely put off!

BOYET

    My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
    Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
    Finely put on!

ROSALINE

    Well, then, I am the shooter.

BOYET

    And who is your deer?

ROSALINE

    If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
    Finely put on, indeed!

MARIA

    You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
    at the brow.

BOYET

    But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

ROSALINE

    Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
    a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
    touching the hit it?

BOYET

    So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
    woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
    wench, as touching the hit it.

ROSALINE

    Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
    Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

BOYET

    An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
    An I cannot, another can.

    Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE

COSTARD

    By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!

MARIA

    A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.

BOYET

    A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
    Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

MARIA

    Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.

COSTARD

    Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.

BOYET

    An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

COSTARD

    Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.

MARIA

    Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.

COSTARD

    She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.

BOYET

    I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.

    Exeunt BOYET and MARIA

COSTARD

    By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
    Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
    O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
    vulgar wit!
    When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
    were, so fit.
    Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
    To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
    To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
    will swear!
    And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
    Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
    Sola, sola!

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL 

SIR NATHANIEL

    Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
    of a good conscience.

HOLOFERNES

    The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
    as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
    the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
    and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
    the soil, the land, the earth.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
    varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
    assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

DULL

    'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES

    Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
    insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
    explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
    rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
    inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
    uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
    unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
    insert again my haud credo for a deer.

DULL

    I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES

    Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
    O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
    in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
    hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
    replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
    the duller parts:
    And such barren plants are set before us, that we
    thankful should be,
    Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
    do fructify in us more than he.
    For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
    So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
    But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
    Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

DULL

    You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
    What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
    weeks old as yet?

HOLOFERNES

    Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.

DULL

    What is Dictynna?

SIR NATHANIEL

    A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

HOLOFERNES

    The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
    And raught not to five weeks when he came to
    five-score.
    The allusion holds in the exchange.

DULL

    'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.

HOLOFERNES

    God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
    in the exchange.

DULL

    And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
    the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
    that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
    on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
    ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
    please you to abrogate scurrility.

HOLOFERNES

    I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
    The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
    pleasing pricket;
    Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
    sore with shooting.
    The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
    from thicket;
    Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
    If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
    one sorel.
    Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

SIR NATHANIEL

    A rare talent!

DULL

    [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
    him with a talent.

HOLOFERNES

    This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
    foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
    shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
    revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
    memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
    delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
    gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
    thankful for it.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
    parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
    you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
    you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.

HOLOFERNES

    Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
    want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
    I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
    loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.

    Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD

JAQUENETTA

    God give you good morrow, master Parson.

HOLOFERNES

    Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
    pierced, which is the one?

COSTARD

    Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.

HOLOFERNES

    Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
    tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
    for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.

JAQUENETTA

    Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
    letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
    from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.

HOLOFERNES

    Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
    Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
    may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
    Venetia, Venetia,
    Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
    Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
    not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
    Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
    as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?

SIR NATHANIEL

    Ay, sir, and very learned.

HOLOFERNES

    Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.

SIR NATHANIEL

    [Reads]
    If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
    Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
    Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
    Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
    osiers bow'd.
    Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
    Where all those pleasures live that art would
    comprehend:
    If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
    All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
    Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
    Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
    Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
    Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
    That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.

HOLOFERNES

    You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
    accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
    only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
    facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
    Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
    but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
    fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
    so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
    the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
    was this directed to you?

JAQUENETTA

    Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
    queen's lords.

HOLOFERNES

    I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
    snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
    Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
    the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
    to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
    desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
    Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
    he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
    queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
    progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
    sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
    king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
    compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.

JAQUENETTA

    Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!

COSTARD

    Have with thee, my girl.

    Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
    religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--

HOLOFERNES

    Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
    colours. But to return to the verses: did they
    please you, Sir Nathaniel?

SIR NATHANIEL

    Marvellous well for the pen.

HOLOFERNES

    I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
    of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
    you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
    privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
    child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
    will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
    neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
    beseech your society.

SIR NATHANIEL

    And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
    the happiness of life.

HOLOFERNES

    And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.

    To DULL
    Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
    say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
    their game, and we will to our recreation.

    Enter BIRON, with a paper 

BIRON

    The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
    myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
    a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
    word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
    the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
    proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
    Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
    well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
    I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
    love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
    in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
    heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
    and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
    and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
    sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
    it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
    fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
    a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
    with a paper: God give him grace to groan!

    Stands aside

    Enter FERDINAND, with a paper

FERDINAND

    Ay me!

BIRON

    [Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
    thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
    left pap. In faith, secrets!

FERDINAND

    [Reads]
    So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
    To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
    As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
    The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
    Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
    Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
    As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
    Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
    No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
    So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
    Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
    And they thy glory through my grief will show:
    But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
    My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
    O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
    No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

    Steps aside
    What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.

BIRON

    Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!

    Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper

LONGAVILLE

    Ay me, I am forsworn!

BIRON

    Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.

FERDINAND

    In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!

BIRON

    One drunkard loves another of the name.

LONGAVILLE

    Am I the first that have been perjured so?

BIRON

    I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
    Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
    The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

LONGAVILLE

    I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
    O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
    These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.

BIRON

    O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
    Disfigure not his slop.

LONGAVILLE

    This same shall go.

    Reads
    Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
    'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
    Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
    Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
    A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
    Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
    My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
    Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
    Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
    Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
    Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
    If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
    If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
    To lose an oath to win a paradise?

BIRON

    This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
    A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
    God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

LONGAVILLE

    By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.

    Steps aside

    Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

BIRON

DUMAIN

    By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

BIRON

    By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

DUMAIN

    Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.

BIRON

    An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

DUMAIN

    As upright as the cedar.

BIRON

    Stoop, I say;
    Her shoulder is with child.

DUMAIN

    As fair as day.

BIRON

    Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

DUMAIN

    Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

    I would forget her; but a fever she
    Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.

BIRON

    A fever in your blood! why, then incision
    Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

DUMAIN

    Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

BIRON

    Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

DUMAIN

    [Reads]
    On a day--alack the day!--
    Love, whose month is ever May,
    Spied a blossom passing fair
    Playing in the wanton air:
    Through the velvet leaves the wind,
    All unseen, can passage find;
    That the lover, sick to death,
    Wish himself the heaven's breath.
    Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
    Air, would I might triumph so!
    But, alack, my hand is sworn
    Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
    Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
    Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
    Do not call it sin in me,
    That I am forsworn for thee;
    Thou for whom Jove would swear
    Juno but an Ethiope were;
    And deny himself for Jove,
    Turning mortal for thy love.
    This will I send, and something else more plain,
    That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
    O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
    Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
    Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
    For none offend where all alike do dote.

LONGAVILLE

    [Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
    You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
    To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

FERDINAND

    [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
    You chide at him, offending twice as much;
    You do not love Maria; Longaville
    Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
    Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
    His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
    I have been closely shrouded in this bush
    And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
    I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
    Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
    Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
    One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:

    To LONGAVILLE
    You would for paradise break faith, and troth;

    To DUMAIN
    And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
    What will Biron say when that he shall hear
    Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
    How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
    How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
    For all the wealth that ever I did see,
    I would not have him know so much by me.

BIRON

    Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

    Advancing
    Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
    Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
    These worms for loving, that art most in love?
    Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
    There is no certain princess that appears;
    You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
    Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
    But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
    All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
    You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
    But I a beam do find in each of three.
    O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
    Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
    O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
    To see a king transformed to a gnat!
    To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
    And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
    And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
    And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
    Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
    And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
    And where my liege's? all about the breast:
    A caudle, ho!

FERDINAND

    Too bitter is thy jest.
    Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

BIRON

    Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
    I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
    To break the vow I am engaged in;
    I am betray'd, by keeping company
    With men like men of inconstancy.
    When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
    Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
    In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
    Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
    A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
    A leg, a limb?

FERDINAND

    Soft! whither away so fast?
    A true man or a thief that gallops so?

BIRON

    I post from love: good lover, let me go.

    Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD

JAQUENETTA

    God bless the king!

FERDINAND

    What present hast thou there?

COSTARD

    Some certain treason.

FERDINAND

    What makes treason here?

COSTARD

    Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

FERDINAND

    If it mar nothing neither,
    The treason and you go in peace away together.

JAQUENETTA

    I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
    Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.

FERDINAND

    Biron, read it over.

    Giving him the paper
    Where hadst thou it?

JAQUENETTA

    Of Costard.

FERDINAND

    Where hadst thou it?

COSTARD

    Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

    BIRON tears the letter

FERDINAND

    How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?

BIRON

    A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

LONGAVILLE

    It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.

DUMAIN

    It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.

    Gathering up the pieces

BIRON

    [To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
    born to do me shame.
    Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

FERDINAND

    What?

BIRON

    That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
    He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
    Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
    O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

DUMAIN

    Now the number is even.

BIRON

    True, true; we are four.
    Will these turtles be gone?

FERDINAND

    Hence, sirs; away!

COSTARD

    Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

    Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA

BIRON

    Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
    As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
    The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
    Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
    We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
    Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

FERDINAND

    What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

BIRON

    Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
    That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
    At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
    Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
    Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
    What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
    Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
    That is not blinded by her majesty?

FERDINAND

    What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
    My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
    She an attending star, scarce seen a light.

BIRON

    My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
    O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
    Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
    Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
    Where several worthies make one dignity,
    Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
    Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
    Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
    To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
    She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
    A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
    Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
    Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
    And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
    O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

FERDINAND

    By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

BIRON

    Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
    A wife of such wood were felicity.
    O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
    That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
    If that she learn not of her eye to look:
    No face is fair that is not full so black.

FERDINAND

    O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
    The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
    And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

BIRON

    Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
    O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
    It mourns that painting and usurping hair
    Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
    And therefore is she born to make black fair.
    Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
    For native blood is counted painting now;
    And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
    Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

DUMAIN

    To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

LONGAVILLE

    And since her time are colliers counted bright.

FERDINAND

    And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

DUMAIN

    Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

BIRON

    Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
    For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

FERDINAND

    'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
    I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

BIRON

    I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

FERDINAND

    No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

DUMAIN

    I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

LONGAVILLE

    Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

BIRON

    O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
    Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

DUMAIN

    O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
    The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

FERDINAND

    But what of this? are we not all in love?

BIRON

    Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

FERDINAND

    Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
    Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

DUMAIN

    Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

LONGAVILLE

    O, some authority how to proceed;
    Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.

DUMAIN

    Some salve for perjury.

BIRON

    'Tis more than need.
    Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
    Consider what you first did swear unto,
    To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
    Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
    Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
    And abstinence engenders maladies.
    And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
    In that each of you have forsworn his book,
    Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
    For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
    Have found the ground of study's excellence
    Without the beauty of a woman's face?

    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
    Why, universal plodding poisons up
    The nimble spirits in the arteries,
    As motion and long-during action tires
    The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
    Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
    And study too, the causer of your vow;
    For where is any author in the world
    Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
    Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
    And where we are our learning likewise is:
    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
    Do we not likewise see our learning there?
    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
    For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
    In leaden contemplation have found out
    Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
    Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
    Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
    And therefore, finding barren practisers,
    Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
    Lives not alone immured in the brain;
    But, with the motion of all elements,
    Courses as swift as thought in every power,
    And gives to every power a double power,
    Above their functions and their offices.
    It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
    A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
    A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
    When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
    Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
    Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
    Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
    For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
    Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
    Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
    As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
    And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
    Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
    Never durst poet touch a pen to write
    Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
    O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
    And plant in tyrants mild humility.
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
    They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
    They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    That show, contain and nourish all the world:
    Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
    Then fools you were these women to forswear,
    Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
    For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
    Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
    Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
    Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
    Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
    It is religion to be thus forsworn,
    For charity itself fulfills the law,
    And who can sever love from charity?

FERDINAND

    Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

BIRON

    Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
    Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
    In conflict that you get the sun of them.

LONGAVILLE

    Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
    Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

FERDINAND

    And win them too: therefore let us devise
    Some entertainment for them in their tents.

BIRON

    First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
    Then homeward every man attach the hand
    Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
    We will with some strange pastime solace them,
    Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
    For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
    Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

FERDINAND

    Away, away! no time shall be omitted
    That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

BIRON

    Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
    And justice always whirls in equal measure:
    Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
    If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT V
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL 

HOLOFERNES

    Satis quod sufficit.

SIR NATHANIEL

    I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
    have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
    scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
    impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
    out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
    a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
    nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES

    Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
    discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
    ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
    behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
    too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
    were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

SIR NATHANIEL

    A most singular and choice epithet.

    Draws out his table-book

HOLOFERNES

    He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
    than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
    fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
    point-devise companions; such rackers of
    orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
    say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
    e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
    half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
    abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
    would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
    insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Laus Deo, bene intelligo.

HOLOFERNES

    Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
    'twill serve.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Videsne quis venit?

HOLOFERNES

    Video, et gaudeo.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Chirrah!

    To MOTH

HOLOFERNES

    Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Men of peace, well encountered.

HOLOFERNES

    Most military sir, salutation.

MOTH

    [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
    of languages, and stolen the scraps.

COSTARD

    O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
    I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
    for thou art not so long by the head as
    honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
    swallowed than a flap-dragon.

MOTH

    Peace! the peal begins.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?

MOTH

    Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
    b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?

HOLOFERNES

    Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.

MOTH

    Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.

HOLOFERNES

    Quis, quis, thou consonant?

MOTH

    The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
    the fifth, if I.

HOLOFERNES

    I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--

MOTH

    The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
    touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
    home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!

MOTH

    Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.

HOLOFERNES

    What is the figure? what is the figure?

MOTH

    Horns.

HOLOFERNES

    Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.

MOTH

    Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
    your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.

COSTARD

    An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
    have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
    remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
    purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
    the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
    bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
    Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
    ends, as they say.

HOLOFERNES

    O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
    barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
    charge-house on the top of the mountain?

HOLOFERNES

    Or mons, the hill.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

HOLOFERNES

    I do, sans question.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
    affection to congratulate the princess at her
    pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
    rude multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES

    The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
    liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
    the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
    assure you, sir, I do assure.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
    I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
    inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
    remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
    head: and among other important and most serious
    designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
    that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
    grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
    shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
    with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
    heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
    fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
    greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
    travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
    The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
    implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
    present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
    delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
    antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
    curate and your sweet self are good at such
    eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
    were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
    crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
    Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
    show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
    our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
    gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
    the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
    Nine Worthies.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?

HOLOFERNES

    Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
    Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
    limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
    page, Hercules,--
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
    that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.

HOLOFERNES

    Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
    minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
    snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.

MOTH

    An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
    hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
    crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
    offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    For the rest of the Worthies?--

HOLOFERNES

    I will play three myself.

MOTH

    Thrice-worthy gentleman!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Shall I tell you a thing?

HOLOFERNES

    We attend.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
    beseech you, follow.

HOLOFERNES

    Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.

DULL

    Nor understood none neither, sir.

HOLOFERNES

    Allons! we will employ thee.

DULL

    I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
    On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

HOLOFERNES

    Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!

    Exeunt
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA 

PRINCESS

    Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
    If fairings come thus plentifully in:
    A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
    Look you what I have from the loving king.

ROSALINE

    Madame, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS

    Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
    As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
    Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
    That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE

    That was the way to make his godhead wax,
    For he hath been five thousand years a boy.

KATHARINE

    Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.

ROSALINE

    You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.

KATHARINE

    He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
    And so she died: had she been light, like you,
    Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
    She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
    And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

ROSALINE

    What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

KATHARINE

    A light condition in a beauty dark.

ROSALINE

    We need more light to find your meaning out.

KATHARINE

    You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
    Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

ROSALINE

    Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.

KATHARINE

    So do not you, for you are a light wench.

ROSALINE

    Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

KATHARINE

    You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.

ROSALINE

    Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

PRINCESS

    Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
    But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
    Who sent it? and what is it?

ROSALINE

    I would you knew:
    An if my face were but as fair as yours,
    My favour were as great; be witness this.
    Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
    The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
    I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
    I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
    O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

PRINCESS

    Any thing like?

ROSALINE

    Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

PRINCESS

    Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.

KATHARINE

    Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

ROSALINE

    'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
    My red dominical, my golden letter:
    O, that your face were not so full of O's!

KATHARINE

    A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.

PRINCESS

    But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?

KATHARINE

    Madam, this glove.

PRINCESS

    Did he not send you twain?

KATHARINE

    Yes, madam, and moreover
    Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
    A huge translation of hypocrisy,
    Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.

MARIA

    This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
    The letter is too long by half a mile.

PRINCESS

    I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
    The chain were longer and the letter short?

MARIA

    Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

PRINCESS

    We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

ROSALINE

    They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
    That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
    O that I knew he were but in by the week!
    How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
    And wait the season and observe the times
    And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
    And shape his service wholly to my hests
    And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
    So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
    That he should be my fool and I his fate.

PRINCESS

    None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
    As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
    Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
    And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

ROSALINE

    The blood of youth burns not with such excess
    As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

MARIA

    Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

PRINCESS

    Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.

    Enter BOYET

BOYET

    O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

PRINCESS

    Thy news Boyet?

BOYET

    Prepare, madam, prepare!
    Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
    Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
    Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
    Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
    Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

PRINCESS

    Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
    That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.

BOYET

    Under the cool shade of a sycamore
    I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
    When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
    Toward that shade I might behold addrest
    The king and his companions: warily
    I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
    And overheard what you shall overhear,
    That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
    Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
    That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
    Action and accent did they teach him there;
    'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
    And ever and anon they made a doubt
    Presence majestical would put him out,
    'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
    Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
    The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
    I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
    With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
    Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
    One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
    A better speech was never spoke before;
    Another, with his finger and his thumb,
    Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
    The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
    The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
    With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
    With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
    To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.

PRINCESS

    But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET

    They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
    Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
    Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
    And every one his love-feat will advance
    Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
    By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS

    And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
    For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
    And not a man of them shall have the grace,
    Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
    Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
    And then the king will court thee for his dear;
    Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
    So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
    And change your favours too; so shall your loves
    Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.

ROSALINE

    Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE

    But in this changing what is your intent?

PRINCESS

    The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
    They do it but in mocking merriment;
    And mock for mock is only my intent.
    Their several counsels they unbosom shall
    To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
    Upon the next occasion that we meet,
    With visages displayed, to talk and greet.

ROSALINE

    But shall we dance, if they desire to't?

PRINCESS

    No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
    Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
    But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET

    Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
    And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS

    Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
    The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
    There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
    To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
    So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
    And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.

    Trumpets sound within

BOYET

    The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.

    The Ladies mask

    Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked

MOTH

    All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--

BOYET

    Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

MOTH

    A holy parcel of the fairest dames.

    The Ladies turn their backs to him
    That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!

BIRON

    [Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!

MOTH

    That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--

BOYET

    True; out indeed.

MOTH

    Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
    Not to behold--

BIRON

    [Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.

MOTH

    Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
    --with your sun-beamed eyes--

BOYET

    They will not answer to that epithet;
    You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

MOTH

    They do not mark me, and that brings me out.

BIRON

    Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!

    Exit MOTH

ROSALINE

    What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
    If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
    That some plain man recount their purposes
    Know what they would.

BOYET

    What would you with the princess?

BIRON

    Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE

    What would they, say they?

BOYET

    Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE

    Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

BOYET

    She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

FERDINAND

    Say to her, we have measured many miles
    To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET

    They say, that they have measured many a mile
    To tread a measure with you on this grass.

ROSALINE

    It is not so. Ask them how many inches
    Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
    The measure then of one is easily told.

BOYET

    If to come hither you have measured miles,
    And many miles, the princess bids you tell
    How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BIRON

    Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET

    She hears herself.

ROSALINE

    How many weary steps,
    Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
    Are number'd in the travel of one mile?

BIRON

    We number nothing that we spend for you:
    Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
    That we may do it still without accompt.
    Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
    That we, like savages, may worship it.

ROSALINE

    My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

FERDINAND

    Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
    Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
    Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

ROSALINE

    O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
    Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

FERDINAND

    Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
    Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.

ROSALINE

    Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.

    Music plays
    Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.

FERDINAND

    Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

ROSALINE

    You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.

FERDINAND

    Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
    The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

ROSALINE

    Our ears vouchsafe it.

FERDINAND

    But your legs should do it.

ROSALINE

    Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
    We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.

FERDINAND

    Why take we hands, then?

ROSALINE

    Only to part friends:
    Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

FERDINAND

    More measure of this measure; be not nice.

ROSALINE

    We can afford no more at such a price.

FERDINAND

    Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?

ROSALINE

    Your absence only.

FERDINAND

    That can never be.

ROSALINE

    Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
    Twice to your visor, and half once to you.

FERDINAND

    If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

ROSALINE

    In private, then.

FERDINAND

    I am best pleased with that.

    They converse apart

BIRON

    White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS

    Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

BIRON

    Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
    Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
    There's half-a-dozen sweets.

PRINCESS

    Seventh sweet, adieu:
    Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BIRON

    One word in secret.

PRINCESS

    Let it not be sweet.

BIRON

    Thou grievest my gall.

PRINCESS

    Gall! bitter.

BIRON

    Therefore meet.

    They converse apart

DUMAIN

    Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

MARIA

    Name it.

DUMAIN

    Fair lady,--

MARIA

    Say you so? Fair lord,--
    Take that for your fair lady.

DUMAIN

    Please it you,
    As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

    They converse apart

KATHARINE

    What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

LONGAVILLE

    I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

KATHARINE

    O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.

LONGAVILLE

    You have a double tongue within your mask,
    And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHARINE

    Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

LONGAVILLE

    A calf, fair lady!

KATHARINE

    No, a fair lord calf.

LONGAVILLE

    Let's part the word.

KATHARINE

    No, I'll not be your half
    Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE

    Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
    Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.

KATHARINE

    Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE

    One word in private with you, ere I die.

KATHARINE

    Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.

    They converse apart

BOYET

    The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
    As is the razor's edge invisible,
    Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
    Above the sense of sense; so sensible
    Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
    Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

ROSALINE

    Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

BIRON

    By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

FERDINAND

    Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

PRINCESS

    Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.

    Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors
    Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?

BOYET

    Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

ROSALINE

    Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

PRINCESS

    O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
    Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
    Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
    This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.

ROSALINE

    O, they were all in lamentable cases!
    The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.

PRINCESS

    Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

MARIA

    Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
    No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

KATHARINE

    Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
    And trow you what he called me?

PRINCESS

    Qualm, perhaps.

KATHARINE

    Yes, in good faith.

PRINCESS

    Go, sickness as thou art!

ROSALINE

    Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
    But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.

PRINCESS

    And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.

KATHARINE

    And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA

    Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET

    Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
    Immediately they will again be here
    In their own shapes; for it can never be
    They will digest this harsh indignity.

PRINCESS

    Will they return?

BOYET

    They will, they will, God knows,
    And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
    Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
    Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

PRINCESS

    How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.

BOYET

    Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
    Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
    Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

PRINCESS

    Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
    If they return in their own shapes to woo?

ROSALINE

    Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
    Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
    Let us complain to them what fools were here,
    Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
    And wonder what they were and to what end
    Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
    And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
    Should be presented at our tent to us.

BOYET

    Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

PRINCESS

    Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

    Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA

    Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits

FERDINAND

    Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?

BOYET

    Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
    Command me any service to her thither?

FERDINAND

    That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

BOYET

    I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.

    Exit

BIRON

    This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
    And utters it again when God doth please:
    He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
    At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
    Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
    This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
    Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
    A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
    This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
    That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
    In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
    A mean most meanly; and in ushering
    Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
    The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
    This is the flower that smiles on every one,
    To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
    And consciences, that will not die in debt,
    Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

FERDINAND

    A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
    That put Armado's page out of his part!

BIRON

    See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
    Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?

    Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE

FERDINAND

    All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

PRINCESS

    'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

FERDINAND

    Construe my speeches better, if you may.

PRINCESS

    Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

FERDINAND

    We came to visit you, and purpose now
    To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

PRINCESS

    This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
    Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.

FERDINAND

    Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
    The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

PRINCESS

    You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
    For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
    Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
    As the unsullied lily, I protest,
    A world of torments though I should endure,
    I would not yield to be your house's guest;
    So much I hate a breaking cause to be
    Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.

FERDINAND

    O, you have lived in desolation here,
    Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

PRINCESS

    Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
    We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
    A mess of Russians left us but of late.

FERDINAND

    How, madam! Russians!

PRINCESS

    Ay, in truth, my lord;
    Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

ROSALINE

    Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
    My lady, to the manner of the days,
    In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
    We four indeed confronted were with four
    In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
    And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
    They did not bless us with one happy word.
    I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
    When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

BIRON

    This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
    Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
    With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
    By light we lose light: your capacity
    Is of that nature that to your huge store
    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

ROSALINE

    This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--

BIRON

    I am a fool, and full of poverty.

ROSALINE

    But that you take what doth to you belong,
    It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

BIRON

    O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

ROSALINE

    All the fool mine?

BIRON

    I cannot give you less.

ROSALINE

    Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

BIRON

    Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

ROSALINE

    There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
    That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

FERDINAND

    We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.

DUMAIN

    Let us confess and turn it to a jest.

PRINCESS

    Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?

ROSALINE

    Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
    Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

BIRON

    Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
    Can any face of brass hold longer out?

Here stand I

    lady, dart thy skill at me;
    Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
    Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
    And I will wish thee never more to dance,
    Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
    Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
    Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
    Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
    Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
    I do forswear them; and I here protest,
    By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
    Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
    In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
    And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE

    Sans sans, I pray you.

BIRON

    Yet I have a trick
    Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
    I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
    Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
    They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
    They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
    These lords are visited; you are not free,
    For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

PRINCESS

    No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

BIRON

    Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

ROSALINE

    It is not so; for how can this be true,
    That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

BIRON

    Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

ROSALINE

    Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

BIRON

    Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

FERDINAND

    Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
    Some fair excuse.

PRINCESS

    The fairest is confession.
    Were not you here but even now disguised?

FERDINAND

    Madam, I was.

PRINCESS

    And were you well advised?

FERDINAND

    I was, fair madam.

PRINCESS

    When you then were here,
    What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

FERDINAND

    That more than all the world I did respect her.

PRINCESS

    When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.

FERDINAND

    Upon mine honour, no.

PRINCESS

    Peace, peace! forbear:
    Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

FERDINAND

    Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.

PRINCESS

    I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
    What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

ROSALINE

    Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
    As precious eyesight, and did value me
    Above this world; adding thereto moreover
    That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

PRINCESS

    God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
    Most honourably doth unhold his word.

FERDINAND

    What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
    I never swore this lady such an oath.

ROSALINE

    By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
    You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.

FERDINAND

    My faith and this the princess I did give:
    I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS

    Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
    And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
    What, will you have me, or your pearl again?

BIRON

    Neither of either; I remit both twain.
    I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
    Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
    To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
    Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
    Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
    That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
    To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
    Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
    The ladies did change favours: and then we,
    Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
    Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
    We are again forsworn, in will and error.
    Much upon this it is: and might not you

    To BOYET
    Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
    Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
    And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
    And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
    Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
    You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
    Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
    You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
    Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET

    Full merrily
    Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BIRON

    Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.

    Enter COSTARD
    Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, they would know
    Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.

BIRON

    What, are there but three?

COSTARD

    No, sir; but it is vara fine,
    For every one pursents three.

BIRON

    And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD

    Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
    You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
    what we know:
    I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--

BIRON

    Is not nine.

COSTARD

    Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BIRON

    By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
    by reckoning, sir.

BIRON

    How much is it?

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
    sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
    own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
    in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.

BIRON

    Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD

    It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
    Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
    the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.

BIRON

    Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD

    We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
    some care.

    Exit

FERDINAND

    Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.

BIRON

    We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
    To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

FERDINAND

    I say they shall not come.

PRINCESS

    Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
    That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
    Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
    Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
    Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
    When great things labouring perish in their birth.

BIRON

    A right description of our sport, my lord.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
    sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.

    Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper

PRINCESS

    Doth this man serve God?

BIRON

    Why ask you?

PRINCESS

    He speaks not like a man of God's making.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
    I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
    fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
    will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
    I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

    Exit

FERDINAND

    Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
    presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
    Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
    Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
    these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
    These four will change habits, and present the other five.

BIRON

    There is five in the first show.

FERDINAND

    You are deceived; 'tis not so.

BIRON

    The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
    and the boy:--
    Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
    Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

FERDINAND

    The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.

    Enter COSTARD, for Pompey

COSTARD

    I Pompey am,--

BOYET

    You lie, you are not he.

COSTARD

    I Pompey am,--

BOYET

    With libbard's head on knee.

BIRON

    Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
    with thee.

COSTARD

    I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--

DUMAIN

    The Great.

COSTARD

    It is, 'Great,' sir:--
    Pompey surnamed the Great;
    That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
    my foe to sweat:
    And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
    And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
    If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

PRINCESS

    Great thanks, great Pompey.

COSTARD

    'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
    made a little fault in 'Great.'

BIRON

    My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.

    Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander

SIR NATHANIEL

    When in the world I lived, I was the world's
    commander;
    By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
    conquering might:
    My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--

BOYET

    Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.

BIRON

    Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

PRINCESS

    The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.

SIR NATHANIEL

    When in the world I lived, I was the world's
    commander,--

BOYET

    Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

BIRON

    Pompey the Great,--

COSTARD

    Your servant, and Costard.

BIRON

    Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD

    [To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
    Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
    the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
    his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
    to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
    and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.

    SIR NATHANIEL retires
    There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
    honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
    marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
    bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
    'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
    a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules

HOLOFERNES

    Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
    Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
    And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
    Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
    Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
    Ergo I come with this apology.
    Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.

    MOTH retires
    Judas I am,--

DUMAIN

    A Judas!

HOLOFERNES

    Not Iscariot, sir.
    Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.

DUMAIN

    Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

BIRON

    A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

HOLOFERNES

    Judas I am,--

DUMAIN

    The more shame for you, Judas.

HOLOFERNES

    What mean you, sir?

BOYET

    To make Judas hang himself.

HOLOFERNES

    Begin, sir; you are my elder.

BIRON

    Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

HOLOFERNES

    I will not be put out of countenance.

BIRON

    Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES

    What is this?

BOYET

    A cittern-head.

DUMAIN

    The head of a bodkin.

BIRON

    A Death's face in a ring.

LONGAVILLE

    The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

BOYET

    The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

DUMAIN

    The carved-bone face on a flask.

BIRON

    Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN

    Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BIRON

    Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
    And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

HOLOFERNES

    You have put me out of countenance.

BIRON

    False; we have given thee faces.

HOLOFERNES

    But you have out-faced them all.

BIRON

    An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

BOYET

    Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
    And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

DUMAIN

    For the latter end of his name.

BIRON

    For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

HOLOFERNES

    This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.

BOYET

    A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.

    HOLOFERNES retires

PRINCESS

    Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector

BIRON

    Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.

DUMAIN

    Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

FERDINAND

    Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

BOYET

    But is this Hector?

FERDINAND

    I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.

LONGAVILLE

    His leg is too big for Hector's.

DUMAIN

    More calf, certain.

BOYET

    No; he is best endued in the small.

BIRON

    This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN

    He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
    Gave Hector a gift,--

DUMAIN

    A gilt nutmeg.

BIRON

    A lemon.

LONGAVILLE

    Stuck with cloves.

DUMAIN

    No, cloven.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Peace!--
    The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
    Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
    A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
    From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
    I am that flower,--

DUMAIN

    That mint.

LONGAVILLE

    That columbine.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

LONGAVILLE

    I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.

DUMAIN

    Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
    beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
    he was a man. But I will forward with my device.

    To the PRINCESS
    Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.

PRINCESS

    Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

BOYET

    [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--

DUMAIN

    [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--

COSTARD

    The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
    is two months on her way.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What meanest thou?

COSTARD

    Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
    wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
    her belly already: tis yours.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
    die.

COSTARD

    Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
    quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
    him.

DUMAIN

    Most rare Pompey!

BOYET

    Renowned Pompey!

BIRON

    Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
    Pompey the Huge!

DUMAIN

    Hector trembles.

BIRON

    Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
    on! stir them on!

DUMAIN

    Hector will challenge him.

BIRON

    Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
    sup a flea.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By the north pole, I do challenge thee.

COSTARD

    I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
    I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
    let me borrow my arms again.

DUMAIN

    Room for the incensed Worthies!

COSTARD

    I'll do it in my shirt.

DUMAIN

    Most resolute Pompey!

MOTH

    Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
    not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
    you? You will lose your reputation.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
    in my shirt.

DUMAIN

    You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet bloods, I both may and will.

BIRON

    What reason have you for't?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
    woolward for penance.

BOYET

    True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
    linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
    a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
    his heart for a favour.

    Enter MERCADE

MERCADE

    God save you, madam!

PRINCESS

    Welcome, Mercade;
    But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.

MERCADE

    I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
    Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--

PRINCESS

    Dead, for my life!

MERCADE

    Even so; my tale is told.

BIRON

    Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
    seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
    discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.

    Exeunt Worthies

FERDINAND

    How fares your majesty?

PRINCESS

    Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.

FERDINAND

    Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.

PRINCESS

    Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
    For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
    Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
    In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    The liberal opposition of our spirits,
    If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
    In the converse of breath: your gentleness
    Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
    A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
    Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
    For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

FERDINAND

    The extreme parts of time extremely forms
    All causes to the purpose of his speed,
    And often at his very loose decides
    That which long process could not arbitrate:
    And though the mourning brow of progeny
    Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
    The holy suit which fain it would convince,
    Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
    Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
    From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
    Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
    As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

PRINCESS

    I understand you not: my griefs are double.

BIRON

    Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
    And by these badges understand the king.
    For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
    Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
    Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
    Even to the opposed end of our intents:
    And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
    As love is full of unbefitting strains,
    All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
    Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
    Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
    Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
    To every varied object in his glance:
    Which parti-coated presence of loose love
    Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
    Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
    Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
    Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
    Our love being yours, the error that love makes
    Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
    By being once false for ever to be true
    To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
    And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
    Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

PRINCESS

    We have received your letters full of love;
    Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
    And, in our maiden council, rated them
    At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
    As bombast and as lining to the time:
    But more devout than this in our respects
    Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
    In their own fashion, like a merriment.

DUMAIN

    Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

LONGAVILLE

    So did our looks.

ROSALINE

    We did not quote them so.

FERDINAND

    Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
    Grant us your loves.

PRINCESS

    A time, methinks, too short
    To make a world-without-end bargain in.
    No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
    Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
    If for my love, as there is no such cause,
    You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
    Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
    To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
    Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
    There stay until the twelve celestial signs
    Have brought about the annual reckoning.
    If this austere insociable life
    Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
    If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
    Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
    But that it bear this trial and last love;
    Then, at the expiration of the year,
    Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
    And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
    I will be thine; and till that instant shut
    My woeful self up in a mourning house,
    Raining the tears of lamentation
    For the remembrance of my father's death.
    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
    Neither entitled in the other's heart.

FERDINAND

    If this, or more than this, I would deny,
    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
    The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
    Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.

DUMAIN

    But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?

KATHARINE

    A beard, fair health, and honesty;
    With three-fold love I wish you all these three.

DUMAIN

    O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?

KATHARINE

    Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
    I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
    Come when the king doth to my lady come;
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

DUMAIN

    I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

KATHARINE

    Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

LONGAVILLE

    What says Maria?

MARIA

    At the twelvemonth's end
    I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

LONGAVILLE

    I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

MARIA

    The liker you; few taller are so young.

BIRON

    Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
    Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
    What humble suit attends thy answer there:
    Impose some service on me for thy love.

ROSALINE

    Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
    Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
    Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
    Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
    Which you on all estates will execute
    That lie within the mercy of your wit.
    To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
    And therewithal to win me, if you please,
    Without the which I am not to be won,
    You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
    Visit the speechless sick and still converse
    With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
    With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
    To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

BIRON

    To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
    It cannot be; it is impossible:
    Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

ROSALINE

    Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
    Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
    A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
    Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
    Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
    Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
    Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
    And I will have you and that fault withal;
    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
    And I shall find you empty of that fault,
    Right joyful of your reformation.

BIRON

    A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
    I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

PRINCESS

    [To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.

FERDINAND

    No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

BIRON

    Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
    Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
    Might well have made our sport a comedy.

FERDINAND

    Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
    And then 'twill end.

BIRON

    That's too long for a play.

    Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--

PRINCESS

    Was not that Hector?

DUMAIN

    The worthy knight of Troy.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
    a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
    plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
    esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
    the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
    owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
    end of our show.

FERDINAND

    Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Holla! approach.

    Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others
    This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
    the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
    cuckoo. Ver, begin.

    THE SONG
    SPRING.
    When daisies pied and violets blue
    And lady-smocks all silver-white
    And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
    Do paint the meadows with delight,
    The cuckoo then, on every tree,
    Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
    Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
    Unpleasing to a married ear!
    When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
    And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
    When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
    And maidens bleach their summer smocks
    The cuckoo then, on every tree,
    Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
    Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
    Unpleasing to a married ear!
    WINTER.
    When icicles hang by the wall
    And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
    And Tom bears logs into the hall
    And milk comes frozen home in pail,
    When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
    Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
    Tu-who, a merry note,
    While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
    When all aloud the wind doth blow
    And coughing drowns the parson's saw
    And birds sit brooding in the snow
    And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
    When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
    Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
    Tu-who, a merry note,
    While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
    Apollo. You that way: we this way.
