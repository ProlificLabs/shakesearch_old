className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e die,\nBut as the riper should by time decease,\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\nFeed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\nThy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\nThou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\nAnd, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\n  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.\n\n\n                    2\n\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,\nThy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held:\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\nHow much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,\nIf thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’\nProving his beauty by succession thine.\n  This were to be new made when thou art old,\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.\n\n\n                    3\n\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,\nNow is the time that face should form another,\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\nFor where is she so fair whose uneared womb\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb\nOf his self-love to stop posterity?\nThou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime,\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\n  But if thou live remembered not to be,\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.\n\n\n                    4\n\nUnthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,\nUpon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?\nNature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\nThen beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\nProfitless usurer why dost thou use\nSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?\nFor having traffic with thy self alone,\nThou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\n  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\n  Which used lives th’ executor to be.\n\n\n                    5\n\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\nWill play the tyrants to the very same,\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\nFor \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets1\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:\nThen were not summer’s distillation left\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\n  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\n  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.\n\n\n                    6\n\nThen let not winter’s ragged hand deface,\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,\nWith beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\nThat’s for thy self to breed another thee,\nOr ten times happier be it ten for one,\nTen times thy self were happier than thou art,\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\n  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,\n  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.\n\n\n                    7\n\nLo in the orient when the gracious light\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\nServing with looks his sacred majesty,\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car,\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\nThe eyes (fore duteous) now converted are\nFrom his low tract and look another way:\n  So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\n\n\n                    8\n\nMusic to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\nWhy lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,\nOr else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\nBy unions married do offend thine ear,\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:\nMark how one string sweet husband to another,\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\nResembling sire, and child, and happy mother,\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\n  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.\n\n\n                    9\n\nIs it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,\nThat thou consum’st thy self in single life?\nAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife,\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep,\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\nBy children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\nBut beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it:\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\n  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.\n\n\n                    10\n\nFor shame deny that thou bear’st love to any\nWho for thy self art so unprovident.\nGrant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\nBut that thou none lov’st is most evident:\nFor thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,\nThat ’gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:\nO change thy thought, that I may change my mind,\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\nBe as thy presence is gracious and kind,\nOr to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n\n\n                    11\n\nAs fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest,\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,\nThou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay,\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\nAnd threescore year would make the world away:\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\nLook whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\n\n\n                    12\n\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\nAnd sable curls all silvered o’er with white:\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd\nAnd summer’s green all girded up in sheaves\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow,\n  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence\n  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.\n\n\n                    13\n\nO that you were your self, but love you are\nNo longer yours, than you your self here live,\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\nFind no determination, then you were\nYour self again after your self’s decease,\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter’s day\nAnd barren rage of death’s eternal cold?\n  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,\n  You had a father, let your son say so.\n\n\n                    14\n\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck,\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\nBut not to tell of good, or evil luck,\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\nIf from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,\n  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.\n\n\n                    15\n\nWhen I consider every thing that grows\nHolds in perfection but a little moment.\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment.\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky:\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory.\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay,\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\nWhere wasteful time debateth with decay\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\n\n\n                    16\n\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time?\nAnd fortify your self in your decay\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\nAnd many maiden gardens yet unset,\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\nWhich this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\nCan make you live your self in eyes of men.\n  To give away your self, keeps your self still,\n  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.\n\n\n                    17\n\nWho will believe my verse in time to come\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts:\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\nThe age to come would say this poet lies,\nSuch heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.\nSo should my papers (yellowed with their age)\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\n  You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.\n\n\n                    18\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed,\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,\nNor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\n\n                    19\n\nDevouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood,\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,\nAnd do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets:\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime,\nO carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,\nHim in thy course untainted do allow,\nFor beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.\n  Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\n\n\n                    20\n\nA woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,\nHast thou the master mistress of my passion,\nA woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted\nWith shifting change as is false women’s fashion,\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth,\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\nWhich steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created,\nTill nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\n  But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,\n  Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.\n\n\n                    21\n\nSo is it not with me as with that muse,\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\nWho heaven it self for ornament doth use,\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:\nWith April’s first-born flowers and all things rare,\nThat heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.\nO let me true in love but truly write,\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair,\nAs any mother’s child, though not so bright\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\n\n\n                    22\n\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\nBut when in thee time’s furrows I behold,\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\nO therefore love be of thyself so wary,\nAs I not for my self, but for thee will,\nBearing thy heart which I will keep so chary\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\n  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\n  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.\n\n\n                    23\n\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\nWhose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;\nSo I for fear of trust, forget to say,\nThe perfect ceremony of love’s rite,\nAnd in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,\nO’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might:\nO let my looks be then the eloquence,\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.\n  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.\n\n\n                    24\n\nMine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,\nThy beauty’s form in table of my heart,\nMy body is the frame wherein ’tis held,\nAnd perspective it is best painter’s art.\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\nWhich in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\n\n\n                    25\n\nLet those who are in favour with their stars,\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\nWhilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars\nUnlooked for joy in that I honour most;\nGreat princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,\nBut as the marigold at the sun’s eye,\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\n  Then happy I that love and am beloved\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n\n\n                    26\n\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit;\nTo thee I send this written embassage\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit.\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\nIn thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving,\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect,\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\n\n\n                    27\n\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tired,\nBut then begins a journey in my head\nTo work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.\nFor then my thoughts (from far where I abide)\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see.\nSave that my soul’s imaginary sight\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\nWhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\n  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,\n  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.\n\n\n                    28\n\nHow can I then return in happy plight\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest?\nWhen day’s oppression is not eased by night,\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed.\nAnd each (though enemies to either’s reign)\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\nI tell the day to please him thou art bright,\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\nSo flatter I the swart-complexioned night,\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\n  And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger\n\n\n                    29\n\nWhen in disgrace with Fortune and men’s eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon my self and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\nDesiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least,\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\n\n                    30\n\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:\nThen can I drown an eye (unused to flow)\nFor precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe,\nAnd moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight.\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o’er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\n  But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)\n  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.\n\n\n                    31\n\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\nAnd there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\nHath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear,\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie.\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\nThat due of many, now is thine alone.\n  Their images I loved, I view in thee,\n  And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.\n\n\n                    32\n\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\nWhen that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:\nCompare them with the bett’ring of the time,\nAnd though they be outstripped by every pen,\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\nO then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,\n’Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\n  Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’.\n\n\n                    33\n\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen,\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\nKissing with golden face the meadows green;\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride,\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow,\nBut out alack, he was but one hour mine,\nThe region cloud hath masked him from me now.\n  Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,\n  Suns of the world may stain, when heaven’s sun staineth.\n\n\n                    34\n\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\nTo let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,\nHiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke?\n’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief,\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss,\nTh’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief\nTo him that bears the strong offence’s cross.\n  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\n  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.\n\n\n                    35\n\nNo more be grieved at that which thou hast done,\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\nMy self corrupting salving thy amiss,\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are:\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,\nThy adverse party is thy advocate,\nAnd ’gainst my self a lawful plea commence:\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate,\n  That I an accessary needs must be,\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\n\n\n                    36\n\nLet me confess that we two must be twain,\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\nWhich though it alter not love’s sole effect,\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    37\n\nAs a decrepit father takes delight,\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\nSo I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\nOr any of these all, or all, or more\nEntitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\nI make my love engrafted to this store:\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give,\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed,\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live:\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,\n  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.\n\n\n                    38\n\nHow can my muse want subject to invent\nWhile thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse,\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent,\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\nO give thy self the thanks if aught in me,\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight,\nFor who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\nWhen thou thy self dost give invention light?\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate,\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\n  If my slight muse do please these curious days,\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\n\n\n                    39\n\nO how thy worth with manners may I sing,\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring:\nAnd what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?\nEven for this, let us divided live,\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\nThat by this separation I may give:\nThat due to thee which thou deserv’st alone:\nO absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\n\n\n                    40\n\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all,\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:\nThen if for my love, thou my love receivest,\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,\nBut yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest\nBy wilful taste of what thy self refusest.\nI do forgive thy robbery gentle thief\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\nAnd yet love knows it is a greater grief\nTo bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury.\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\n  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\n\n\n                    41\n\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman’s son,\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\nAy me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\nAnd chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\n  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\n  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\n\n\n                    42\n\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly,\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye,\nThou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her,\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\nSuff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her.\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss,\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross,\n  But here’s the joy, my friend and I are one,\n  Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.\n\n\n                    43\n\nWhen most I wink then do mine eyes best see,\nFor all the day they view things unrespected,\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\nThen thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright\nHow would thy shadow’s form, form happy show,\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\nHow would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\n\n\n                    44\n\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\nInjurious distance should not stop my way,\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay,\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\nUpon the farthest earth removed from thee,\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\nBut ah, thought kills me that I am not thought\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\nI must attend, time’s leisure with my moan.\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow,\n  But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.\n\n\n                    45\n\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire,\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide,\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\nMy life being made of four, with two alone,\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.\nUntil life’s composition be recured,\nBy those swift messengers returned from thee,\nWho even but now come back again assured,\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me.\n  This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,\n  I send them back again and straight grow sad.\n\n\n                    46\n\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight,\nMine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,\nMy heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\n(A closet \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets2\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e pierced with crystal eyes)\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\nTo side this title is impanelled\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,\nAnd by their verdict is determined\nThe clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.\n  As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part,\n  And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.\n\n\n                    47\n\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other,\nWhen that mine eye is famished for a look,\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;\nWith my love’s picture then my eye doth feast,\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart:\nAnother time mine eye is my heart’s guest,\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part.\nSo either by thy picture or my love,\nThy self away, art present still with me,\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee.\n  Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\n  Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight.\n\n\n                    48\n\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\nThat to my use it might unused stay\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\nThee have I not locked up in any chest,\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol’n I fear,\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\n\n\n                    49\n\nAgainst that time (if ever that time come)\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\nCalled to that audit by advised respects,\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,\nWhen love converted from the thing it was\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part,\n  To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,\n  Since why to love, I can allege no cause.\n\n\n                    50\n\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\nWhen what I seek (my weary travel’s end)\nDoth teach that case and that repose to say\n’Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\nHis rider loved not speed being made from thee:\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side,\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\n  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.\n\n\n                    51\n\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence,\nOf my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,\nFrom where thou art, why should I haste me thence?\nTill I return of posting is no need.\nO what excuse will my poor beast then find,\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\nThen should I spur though mounted on the wind,\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know,\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace,\nTherefore desire (of perfect’st love being made)\nShall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,\n  Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\n  Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.\n\n\n                    52\n\nSo am I as the rich whose blessed key,\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\nSince seldom coming in that long year set,\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\nBy new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\n  Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.\n\n\n                    53\n\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\nSince every one, hath every one, one shade,\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend:\nDescribe Adonis and the counterfeit,\nIs poorly imitated after you,\nOn Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set,\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\nThe other as your bounty doth appear,\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\n  In all external grace you have some part,\n  But you like none, none you for constant heart.\n\n\n                    54\n\nO how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\nFor that sweet odour, which doth in it live:\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye,\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,\nWhen summer’s breath their masked buds discloses:\nBut for their virtue only is their show,\nThey live unwooed, and unrespected fade,\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,\nOf their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:\n  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\n  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.\n\n\n                    55\n\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\nThan unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\nNor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn:\nThe living record of your memory.\n’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity\nShall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\n  So till the judgment that your self arise,\n  You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.\n\n\n                    56\n\nSweet love renew thy force, be it not said\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\nWhich but to-day by feeding is allayed,\nTo-morrow sharpened in his former might.\nSo love be thou, although to-day thou fill\nThy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\nTo-morrow see again, and do not kill\nThe spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new,\nCome daily to the banks, that when they see:\nReturn of love, more blest may be the view.\n  Or call it winter, which being full of care,\n  Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\n\n\n                    57\n\nBeing your slave what should I do but tend,\nUpon the hours, and times of your desire?\nI have no precious time at all to spend;\nNor services to do till you require.\nNor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,\nWhilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour,\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu.\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought,\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\nBut like a sad slave stay and think of nought\nSave where you are, how happy you make those.\n  So true a fool is love, that in your will,\n  (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.\n\n\n                    58\n\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\nOr at your hand th’ account of hours to crave,\nBeing your vassal bound to stay your leisure.\nO let me suffer (being at your beck)\nTh’ imprisoned absence of your liberty,\nAnd patience tame to sufferance bide each check,\nWithout accusing you of injury.\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong,\nThat you your self may privilage your time\nTo what you will, to you it doth belong,\nYour self to pardon of self-doing crime.\n  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\n  Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\n\n\n                    59\n\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is,\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\nWhich labouring for invention bear amis\nThe second burthen of a former child!\nO that record could with a backward look,\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\nShow me your image in some antique book,\nSince mind at first in character was done.\nThat I might see what the old world could say,\nTo this composed wonder of your frame,\nWhether we are mended, or whether better they,\nOr whether revolution be the same.\n  O sure I am the wits of former days,\n  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\n\n\n                    60\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\nNativity once in the main of light,\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\nCrooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight,\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,\nFeeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\n  And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\n  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n\n                    61\n\nIs it thy will, thy image should keep open\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\nIs it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\nThe scope and tenure of thy jealousy?\nO no, thy love though much, is not so great,\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake,\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\nTo play the watchman ever for thy sake.\n  For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\n  From me far off, with others all too near.\n\n\n                    62\n\nSin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,\nAnd all my soul, and all my every part;\nAnd for this sin there is no remedy,\nIt is so grounded inward in my heart.\nMethinks no face so gracious is as mine,\nNo shape so true, no truth of such account,\nAnd for my self mine own worth do define,\nAs I all other in all worths surmount.\nBut when my glass shows me my self indeed\nbeated and chopt with tanned antiquity,\nMine own self-love quite contrary I read:\nSelf, so self-loving were iniquity.\n  ’Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,\n  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.\n\n\n                    63\n\nAgainst my love shall be as I am now\nWith Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn,\nWhen hours have drained his blood and filled his brow\nWith lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn\nHath travelled on to age’s steepy night,\nAnd all those beauties whereof now he’s king\nAre vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\nStealing away the treasure of his spring:\nFor such a time do I now fortify\nAgainst confounding age’s cruel knife,\nThat he shall \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets3\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e cut from memory\nMy sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life.\n  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\n  And they shall live, and he in them still green.\n\n\n                    64\n\nWhen I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced\nThe rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,\nWhen sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,\nAnd brass eternal slave to mortal rage.\nWhen I have seen the hungry ocean gain\nAdvantage on the kingdom of the shore,\nAnd the firm soil win of the watery main,\nIncreasing store with loss, and loss with store.\nWhen I have seen such interchange of State,\nOr state it self confounded, to decay,\nRuin hath taught me thus to ruminate\nThat Time will come and take my love away.\n  This thought is as a death which cannot choose\n  But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.\n\n\n                    65\n\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\nBut sad mortality o’ersways their power,\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\nO how shall summer’s honey breath hold out,\nAgainst the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\nNor gates of steel so strong but time decays?\nO fearful meditation, where alack,\nShall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\n  O none, unless this miracle have might,\n  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\n\n\n                    66\n\nTired with all these for restful death I cry,\nAs to behold desert a beggar born,\nAnd needy nothing trimmed in jollity,\nAnd purest faith unhappily forsworn,\nAnd gilded honour shamefully misplaced,\nAnd maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\nAnd right perfection wrongfully disgraced,\nAnd strength by limping sway disabled\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\nAnd folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,\nAnd simple truth miscalled simplicity,\nAnd captive good attending captain ill.\n  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\n  Save that to die, I leave my love alone.\n\n\n                    67\n\nAh wherefore with infection should he live,\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve,\nAnd lace it self with his society?\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek,\nAnd steal dead seeming of his living hue?\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek,\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\nWhy should he live, now nature bankrupt is,\nBeggared of blood to blush through lively veins,\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\nAnd proud of many, lives upon his gains?\n  O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,\n  In days long since, before these last so bad.\n\n\n                    68\n\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were born,\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow:\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\nThe right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\nTo live a second life on second head,\nEre beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\nWithout all ornament, it self and true,\nMaking no summer of another’s green,\nRobbing no old to dress his beauty new,\n  And him as for a map doth Nature store,\n  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\n\n\n                    69\n\nThose parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view,\nWant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:\nAll tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,\nUttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\nThy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,\nBut those same tongues that give thee so thine own,\nIn other accents do this praise confound\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\nAnd that in guess they measure by thy deeds,\nThen churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\n  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\n  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\n\n\n                    70\n\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\nFor slander’s mark was ever yet the fair,\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\nA crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve,\nThy worth the greater being wooed of time,\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\nAnd thou present’st a pure unstained prime.\nThou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\nEither not assailed, or victor being charged,\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\nTo tie up envy, evermore enlarged,\n  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\n  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\n\n\n                    71\n\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead,\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\nFrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\nNay if you read this line, remember not,\nThe hand that writ it, for I love you so,\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\nO if (I say) you look upon this verse,\nWhen I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse;\nBut let your love even with my life decay.\n  Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\n  And mock you with me after I am gone.\n\n\n                    72\n\nO lest the world should task you to recite,\nWhat merit lived in me that you should love\nAfter my death (dear love) forget me quite,\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove.\nUnless you would devise some virtuous lie,\nTo do more for me than mine own desert,\nAnd hang more praise upon deceased I,\nThan niggard truth would willingly impart:\nO lest your true love may seem false in this,\nThat you for love speak well of me untrue,\nMy name be buried where my body is,\nAnd live no more to shame nor me, nor you.\n  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\n  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\n\n\n                    73\n\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold,\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\nIn me thou seest the twilight of such day,\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\nDeath’s second self that seals up all in rest.\nIn me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\nAs the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\nConsumed with that which it was nourished by.\n  This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,\n  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\n\n\n                    74\n\nBut be contented when that fell arrest,\nWithout all bail shall carry me away,\nMy life hath in this line some interest,\nWhich for memorial still with thee shall stay.\nWhen thou reviewest this, thou dost review,\nThe very part was consecrate to thee,\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due,\nMy spirit is thine the better part of me,\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead,\nThe coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,\nToo base of thee to be remembered,\n  The worth of that, is that which it contains,\n  And that is this, and this with thee remains.\n\n\n                    75\n\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\nOr as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;\nAnd for the peace of you I hold such strife\nAs ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\nNow proud as an enjoyer, and anon\nDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure,\nNow counting best to be with you alone,\nThen bettered that the world may see my pleasure,\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look,\nPossessing or pursuing no delight\nSave what is had, or must from you be took.\n  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\n  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\n\n\n                    76\n\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride?\nSo far from variation or quick change?\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\nTo new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\nO know sweet love I always write of you,\nAnd you and love are still my argument:\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\nSpending again what is already spent:\n  For as the sun is daily new and old,\n  So is my love still telling what is told.\n\n\n                    77\n\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste,\nThese vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear,\nAnd of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\nThe wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,\nOf mouthed graves will give thee memory,\nThou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know,\nTime’s thievish progress to eternity.\nLook what thy memory cannot contain,\nCommit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\nThose children nursed, delivered from thy brain,\nTo take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\n  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\n  Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.\n\n\n                    78\n\nSo oft have I invoked thee for my muse,\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse,\nAs every alien pen hath got my use,\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\nHave added feathers to the learned’s wing,\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\nWhose influence is thine, and born of thee,\nIn others’ works thou dost but mend the style,\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces graced be.\n  But thou art all my art, and dost advance\n  As high as learning, my rude ignorance.\n\n\n                    79\n\nWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\nMy verse alone had all thy gentle grace,\nBut now my gracious numbers are decayed,\nAnd my sick muse doth give an other place.\nI grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument\nDeserves the travail of a worthier pen,\nYet what of thee thy poet doth invent,\nHe robs thee of, and pays it thee again,\nHe lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,\nFrom thy behaviour, beauty doth he give\nAnd found it in thy cheek: he can afford\nNo praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\n  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\n  Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.\n\n\n                    80\n\nO how I faint when I of you do write,\nKnowing a better spirit doth use your name,\nAnd in the praise thereof spends all his might,\nTo make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.\nBut since your worth (wide as the ocean is)\nThe humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\nMy saucy bark (inferior far to his)\nOn your broad main doth wilfully appear.\nYour shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\nWhilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,\nOr (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,\nHe of tall building, and of goodly pride.\n  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,\n  The worst was this, my love was my decay.\n\n\n                    81\n\nOr I shall live your epitaph to make,\nOr you survive when I in earth am rotten,\nFrom hence your memory death cannot take,\nAlthough in me each part will be forgotten.\nYour name from hence immortal life shall have,\nThough I (once gone) to all the world must die,\nThe earth can yield me but a common grave,\nWhen you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie,\nYour monument shall be my gentle verse,\nWhich eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,\nAnd tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\nWhen all the breathers of this world are dead,\n  You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)\n  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\n\n\n                    82\n\nI grant thou wert not married to my muse,\nAnd therefore mayst without attaint o’erlook\nThe dedicated words which writers use\nOf their fair subject, blessing every book.\nThou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\nFinding thy worth a limit past my praise,\nAnd therefore art enforced to seek anew,\nSome fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\nAnd do so love, yet when they have devised,\nWhat strained touches rhetoric can lend,\nThou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,\nIn true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.\n  And their gross painting might be better used,\n  Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.\n\n\n                    83\n\nI \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets4\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e saw that you did painting need,\nAnd therefore to your fair no painting set,\nI found (or thought I found) you did exceed,\nThat barren tender of a poet’s debt:\nAnd therefore have I slept in your report,\nThat you your self being extant well might show,\nHow far a modern quill doth come too short,\nSpeaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\nThis silence for my sin you did impute,\nWhich shall be most my glory being dumb,\nFor I impair not beauty being mute,\nWhen others would give life, and bring a tomb.\n  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,\n  Than both your poets can in praise devise.\n\n\n                    84\n\nWho is it that says most, which can say more,\nThan this rich praise, that you alone, are you?\nIn whose confine immured is the store,\nWhich should example where your equal grew.\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell,\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory,\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell,\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story.\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\nMaking his style admired every where.\n  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\n  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\n\n\n                    85\n\nMy tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,\nWhile comments of your praise richly compiled,\nReserve their character with golden quill,\nAnd precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\nI think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,\nAnd like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,\nTo every hymn that able spirit affords,\nIn polished form of well refined pen.\nHearing you praised, I say ’tis so, ’tis true,\nAnd to the most of praise add something more,\nBut that is in my thought, whose love to you\n(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,\n  Then others, for the breath of words respect,\n  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\n\n\n                    86\n\nWas it the proud full sail of his great verse,\nBound for the prize of (all too precious) you,\nThat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\nMaking their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\nWas it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\nAbove a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\nNo, neither he, nor his compeers by night\nGiving him aid, my verse astonished.\nHe nor that affable familiar ghost\nWhich nightly gulls him with intelligence,\nAs victors of my silence cannot boast,\nI was not sick of any fear from thence.\n  But when your countenance filled up his line,\n  Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.\n\n\n                    87\n\nFarewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\nAnd like enough thou know’st thy estimate,\nThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:\nMy bonds in thee are all determinate.\nFor how do I hold thee but by thy granting,\nAnd for that riches where is my deserving?\nThe cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\nAnd so my patent back again is swerving.\nThy self thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,\nOr me to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking,\nSo thy great gift upon misprision growing,\nComes home again, on better judgement making.\n  Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,\n  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\n\n\n                    88\n\nWhen thou shalt be disposed to set me light,\nAnd place my merit in the eye of scorn,\nUpon thy side, against my self I’ll fight,\nAnd prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:\nWith mine own weakness being best acquainted,\nUpon thy part I can set down a story\nOf faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:\nThat thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:\nAnd I by this will be a gainer too,\nFor bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\nThe injuries that to my self I do,\nDoing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\n  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\n  That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.\n\n\n                    89\n\nSay that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\nAnd I will comment upon that offence,\nSpeak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:\nAgainst thy reasons making no defence.\nThou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,\nTo set a form upon desired change,\nAs I’ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,\nI will acquaintance strangle and look strange:\nBe absent from thy walks and in my tongue,\nThy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\nLest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:\nAnd haply of our old acquaintance tell.\n  For thee, against my self I’ll vow debate,\n  For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate.\n\n\n                    90\n\nThen hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,\nNow while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\njoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss:\nAh do not, when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow,\nCome in the rearward of a conquered woe,\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\nWhen other petty griefs have done their spite,\nBut in the onset come, so shall I taste\nAt first the very worst of fortune’s might.\n  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\n  Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.\n\n\n                    91\n\nSome glory in their birth, some in their skill,\nSome in their wealth, some in their body’s force,\nSome in their garments though new-fangled ill:\nSome in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.\nAnd every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\nWherein it finds a joy above the rest,\nBut these particulars are not my measure,\nAll these I better in one general best.\nThy love is better than high birth to me,\nRicher than wealth, prouder than garments’ costs,\nOf more delight than hawks and horses be:\nAnd having thee, of all men’s pride I boast.\n  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,\n  All this away, and me most wretchcd make.\n\n\n                    92\n\nBut do thy worst to steal thy self away,\nFor term of life thou art assured mine,\nAnd life no longer than thy love will stay,\nFor it depends upon that love of thine.\nThen need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\nWhen in the least of them my life hath end,\nI see, a better state to me belongs\nThan that, which on thy humour doth depend.\nThou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\nSince that my life on thy revolt doth lie,\nO what a happy title do I find,\nHappy to have thy love, happy to die!\n  But what’s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\n  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\n\n\n                    93\n\nSo shall I live, supposing thou art true,\nLike a deceived husband, so love’s face,\nMay still seem love to me, though altered new:\nThy looks with me, thy heart in other place.\nFor there can live no hatred in thine eye,\nTherefore in that I cannot know thy change,\nIn many’s looks, the false heart’s history\nIs writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.\nBut heaven in thy creation did decree,\nThat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,\nWhate’er thy thoughts, or thy heart’s workings be,\nThy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\n  How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow,\n  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.\n\n\n                    94\n\nThey that have power to hurt, and will do none,\nThat do not do the thing, they most do show,\nWho moving others, are themselves as stone,\nUnmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:\nThey rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,\nAnd husband nature’s riches from expense,\nTibey are the lords and owners of their faces,\nOthers, but stewards of their excellence:\nThe summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,\nThough to it self, it only live and die,\nBut if that flower with base infection meet,\nThe basest weed outbraves his dignity:\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,\n  Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.\n\n\n                    95\n\nHow sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,\nWhich like a canker in the fragrant rose,\nDoth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\nO in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!\nThat tongue that tells the story of thy days,\n(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)\nCannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,\nNaming thy name, blesses an ill report.\nO what a mansion have those vices got,\nWhich for their habitation chose out thee,\nWhere beauty’s veil doth cover every blot,\nAnd all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!\n  Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,\n  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.\n\n\n                    96\n\nSome say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,\nSome say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,\nBoth grace and faults are loved of more and less:\nThou mak’st faults graces, that to thee resort:\nAs on the finger of a throned queen,\nThe basest jewel will be well esteemed:\nSo are those errors that in thee are seen,\nTo truths translated, and for true things deemed.\nHow many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\nIf like a lamb he could his looks translate!\nHow many gazers mightst thou lead away,\nif thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\n\n                    97\n\nHow like a winter hath my absence been\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\nWhat old December’s bareness everywhere!\nAnd yet this time removed was summer’s time,\nThe teeming autumn big with rich increase,\nBearing the wanton burden of the prime,\nLike widowed wombs after their lords’ decease:\nYet this abundant issue seemed to me\nBut hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\nAnd thou away, the very birds are mute.\n  Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,\n  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.\n\n\n                    98\n\nFrom you have I been absent in the spring,\nWhen proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)\nHath put a spirit of youth in every thing:\nThat heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.\nYet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\nOf different flowers in odour and in hue,\nCould make me any summer’s story tell:\nOr from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\nNor did I wonder at the lily’s white,\nNor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,\nThey were but sweet, but figures of delight:\nDrawn after you, you pattern of all those.\n  Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,\n  As with your shadow I with these did play.\n\n\n                    99\n\nThe forward violet thus did I chide,\nSweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\nIf not from my love’s breath? The purple pride\nWhich on thy soft check for complexion dwells,\nIn my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.\nThe lily I condemned for thy hand,\nAnd buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair,\nThe roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\nOne blushing shame, another white despair:\nA third nor red, nor white, had stol’n of both,\nAnd to his robbery had annexed thy breath,\nBut for his theft in pride of all his growth\nA vengeful canker eat him up to death.\n  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\n  But sweet, or colour it had stol’n from thee.\n\n\n                    100\n\nWhere art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long,\nTo speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\nSpend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\nDarkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\nReturn forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,\nIn gentle numbers time so idly spent,\nSing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,\nAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.\nRise resty Muse, my love’s sweet face survey,\nIf time have any wrinkle graven there,\nIf any, be a satire to decay,\nAnd make time’s spoils despised everywhere.\n  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\n  So thou prevent’st his scythe, and crooked knife.\n\n\n                    101\n\nO truant Muse what shall be thy amends,\nFor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\nBoth truth and beauty on my love depends:\nSo dost thou too, and therein dignified:\nMake answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,\n’Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,\nBeauty no pencil, beauty’s truth to lay:\nBut best is best, if \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets5\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e intermixed’?\nBecause he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\nExcuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee,\nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb:\nAnd to be praised of ages yet to be.\n  Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,\n  To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.\n\n\n                    102\n\nMy love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,\nI love not less, though less the show appear,\nThat love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,\nThe owner’s tongue doth publish every where.\nOur love was new, and then but in the spring,\nWhen I was wont to greet it with my lays,\nAs Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,\nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\nNot that the summer is less pleasant now\nThan when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\nBut that wild music burthens every bough,\nAnd sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n  Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:\n  Because I would not dull you with my song.\n\n\n                    103\n\nAlack what poverty my muse brings forth,\nThat having such a scope to show her pride,\nThe argument all bare is of more worth\nThan when it hath my added praise beside.\nO blame me not if I no more can write!\nLook in your glass and there appears a face,\nThat over-goes my blunt invention quite,\nDulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\nWere it not sinful then striving to mend,\nTo mar the subject that before was well?\nFor to no other pass my verses tend,\nThan of your graces and your gifts to tell.\n  And more, much more than in my verse can sit,\n  Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.\n\n\n                    104\n\nTo me fair friend you \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets6\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e can be old,\nFor as you were when first your eye I eyed,\nSuch seems your beauty still: three winters cold,\nHave from the forests shook three summers’ pride,\nThree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,\nIn process of the seasons have I seen,\nThree April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,\nSince first I saw you fresh which yet are green.\nAh yet doth beauty like a dial hand,\nSteal from his figure, and no pace perceived,\nSo your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand\nHath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.\n  For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,\n  Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.\n\n\n                    105\n\nLet not my love be called idolatry,\nNor my beloved as an idol show,\nSince all alike my songs and praises be\nTo one, of one, still such, and ever so.\nKind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\nStill constant in a wondrous excellence,\nTherefore my verse to constancy confined,\nOne thing expressing, leaves out difference.\nFair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\nFair, kind, and true, varying to other words,\nAnd in this change is my invention spent,\nThree themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n  Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.\n  Which three till now, \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets7\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e kept seat in one.\n\n\n                    106\n\nWhen in the chronicle of wasted time,\nI see descriptions of the fairest wights,\nAnd beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\nIn praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,\nThen in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,\nOf hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\nI see their antique pen would have expressed,\nEven such a beauty as you master now.\nSo all their praises are but prophecies\nOf this our time, all you prefiguring,\nAnd for they looked but with divining eyes,\nThey had not skill enough your worth to sing:\n  For we which now behold these present days,\n  Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\n\n\n                    107\n\nNot mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,\nOf the wide world, dreaming on things to come,\nCan yet the lease of my true love control,\nSupposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\nThe mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\nAnd the sad augurs mock their own presage,\nIncertainties now crown themselves assured,\nAnd peace proclaims olives of endless age.\nNow with the drops of this most balmy time,\nMy love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\nSince spite of him I’ll live in this poor rhyme,\nWhile he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes.\n  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n  When tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n\n\n                    108\n\nWhat’s in the brain that ink may character,\nWhich hath not figured to thee my true spirit,\nWhat’s new to speak, what now to register,\nThat may express my love, or thy dear merit?\nNothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,\nI must each day say o’er the very same,\nCounting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\nEven as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\nSo that eternal love in love’s fresh case,\nWeighs not the dust and injury of age,\nNor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\nBut makes antiquity for aye his page,\n  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,\n  Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n\n\n                    109\n\nO \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets8\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e say that I was false of heart,\nThough absence seemed my flame to qualify,\nAs easy might I from my self depart,\nAs from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\nThat is my home of love, if I have ranged,\nLike him that travels I return again,\nJust to the time, not with the time exchanged,\nSo that my self bring water for my stain,\n\u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets9\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003eNever\u003c/span\u003e believe though in my nature reigned,\nAll frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\nThat it could so preposterously be stained,\nTo leave for nothing all thy sum of good:\n  For nothing this wide universe I call,\n  Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.\n\n\n                    110\n\nAlas ’tis true, I have gone here and there,\nAnd made my self a motley to the view,\nGored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\nMade old offences of affections new.\nMost true it is, that I have looked on truth\nAskance and strangely: but by all above,\nThese blenches gave my heart another youth,\nAnd worse essays proved thee my best of love.\nNow all is done, have what shall have no end,\nMine appetite I \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets10\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e more will grind\nOn newer proof, to try an older friend,\nA god in love, to whom I am confined.\n  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,\n  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.\n\n\n                    111\n\nO for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\nThat did not better for my life provide,\nThan public means which public manners breeds.\nThence comes it that my name receives a brand,\nAnd almost thence my nature is subdued\nTo what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:\nPity me then, and wish I were renewed,\nWhilst like a willing patient I will drink,\nPotions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection,\nNo bitterness that I will bitter think,\nNor double penance to correct correction.\n  Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,\n  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.\n\n\n                    112\n\nYour love and pity doth th’ impression fill,\nWhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,\nFor what care I who calls me well or ill,\nSo you o’er-green my bad, my good allow?\nYou are my all the world, and I must strive,\nTo know my shames and praises from your tongue,\nNone else to me, nor I to none alive,\nThat my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.\nIn so profound abysm I throw all care\nOf others’ voices, that my adder’s sense,\nTo critic and to flatterer stopped are:\nMark how with my neglect I do dispense.\n  You are so strongly in my purpose bred,\n  That all the world besides methinks are dead.\n\n\n                    113\n\nSince I left you, mine eye is in my mind,\nAnd that which governs me to go about,\nDoth part his function, and is partly blind,\nSeems seeing, but effectually is out:\nFor it no form delivers to the heart\nOf bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,\nOf his quick objects hath the mind no part,\nNor his own vision holds what it doth catch:\nFor if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight,\nThe most sweet favour or deformed’st creature,\nThe mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:\nThe crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.\n  Incapable of more, replete with you,\n  My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.\n\n\n                    114\n\nOr whether doth my mind being crowned with you\nDrink up the monarch’s plague this flattery?\nOr whether shall I say mine eye saith true,\nAnd that your love taught it this alchemy?\nTo make of monsters, and things indigest,\nSuch cherubins as your sweet self resemble,\nCreating every bad a perfect best\nAs fast as objects to his beams assemble:\nO ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing,\nAnd my great mind most kingly drinks it up,\nMine eye well knows what with his gust is ’greeing,\nAnd to his palate doth prepare the cup.\n  If it be poisoned, ’tis the lesser sin,\n  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.\n\n\n                    115\n\nThose lines that I before have writ do lie,\nEven those that said I could not love you dearer,\nYet then my judgment knew no reason why,\nMy most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,\nBut reckoning time, whose millioned accidents\nCreep in ’twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,\nTan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents,\nDivert strong minds to the course of alt’ring things:\nAlas why fearing of time’s tyranny,\nMight I not then say ‘Now I love you best,’\nWhen I was certain o’er incertainty,\nCrowning the present, doubting of the rest?\n  Love is a babe, then might I not say so\n  To give full growth to that which still doth grow.\n\n\n                    116\n\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments, love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\nO no, it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets11\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e shaken;\nIt is the star to every wand’ring bark,\nWhose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle’s compass come,\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom:\n  If this be error and upon me proved,\n  I \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets12\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e writ, nor no man ever loved.\n\n\n                    117\n\nAccuse me thus, that I have scanted all,\nWherein I should your great deserts repay,\nForgot upon your dearest love to call,\nWhereto all bonds do tie me day by day,\nThat I have frequent been with unknown minds,\nAnd given to time your own dear-purchased right,\nThat I have hoisted sail to all the winds\nWhich should transport me farthest from your sight.\nBook both my wilfulness and errors down,\nAnd on just proof surmise, accumulate,\nBring me within the level of your frown,\nBut shoot not at me in your wakened hate:\n  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove\n  The constancy and virtue of your love.\n\n\n                    118\n\nLike as to make our appetite more keen\nWith eager compounds we our palate urge,\nAs to prevent our maladies unseen,\nWe sicken to shun sickness when we purge.\nEven so being full of your ne’er-cloying sweetness,\nTo bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\nAnd sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,\nTo be diseased ere that there was true needing.\nThus policy in love t’ anticipate\nThe ills that were not, grew to faults assured,\nAnd brought to medicine a healthful state\nWhich rank of goodness would by ill be cured.\n  But thence I learn and find the lesson true,\n  Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.\n\n\n                    119\n\nWhat potions have I drunk of Siren tears\nDistilled from limbecks foul as hell within,\nApplying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,\nStill losing when I saw my self to win!\nWhat wretched errors hath my heart committed,\nWhilst it hath thought it self so blessed \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets13\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e!\nHow have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted\nIn the distraction of this madding fever!\nO benefit of ill, now I find true\nThat better is, by evil still made better.\nAnd ruined love when it is built anew\nGrows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.\n  So I return rebuked to my content,\n  And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.\n\n\n                    120\n\nThat you were once unkind befriends me now,\nAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feel,\nNeeds must I under my transgression bow,\nUnless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.\nFor if you were by my unkindness shaken\nAs I by yours, y’have passed a hell of time,\nAnd I a tyrant have no leisure taken\nTo weigh how once I suffered in your crime.\nO that our night of woe might have remembered\nMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\nAnd soon to you, as you to me then tendered\nThe humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\n  But that your trespass now becomes a fee,\n  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\n\n\n                    121\n\n’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,\nWhen not to be, receives reproach of being,\nAnd the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,\nNot by our feeling, but by others’ seeing.\nFor why should others’ false adulterate eyes\nGive salutation to my sportive blood?\nOr on my frailties why are frailer spies,\nWhich in their wills count bad what I think good?\nNo, I am that I am, and they that level\nAt my abuses, reckon up their own,\nI may be straight though they themselves be bevel;\nBy their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown\n  Unless this general evil they maintain,\n  All men are bad and in their badness reign.\n\n\n                    122\n\nThy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\nFull charactered with lasting memory,\nWhich shall above that idle rank remain\nBeyond all date even to eternity.\nOr at the least, so long as brain and heart\nHave faculty by nature to subsist,\nTill each to razed oblivion yield his part\nOf thee, thy record \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets14\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e can be missed:\nThat poor retention could not so much hold,\nNor need I tallies thy dear love to score,\nTherefore to give them from me was I bold,\nTo trust those tables that receive thee more:\n  To keep an adjunct to remember thee\n  Were to import forgetfulness in me.\n\n\n                    123\n\nNo! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,\nThy pyramids built up with newer might\nTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange,\nThey are but dressings Of a former sight:\nOur dates are brief, and therefore we admire,\nWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old,\nAnd rather make them born to our desire,\nThan think that we before have heard them told:\nThy registers and thee I both defy,\nNot wond’ring at the present, nor the past,\nFor thy records, and what we see doth lie,\nMade more or less by thy continual haste:\n  This I do vow and this shall ever be,\n  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\n\n\n                    124\n\nIf my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune’s bastard be unfathered,\nAs subject to time’s love or to time’s hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.\nNo it was builded far from accident,\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th’ inviting time our fashion calls:\nIt fears not policy that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-numbered hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.\n  To this I witness call the fools of time,\n  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\n\n\n                    125\n\nWere’t aught to me I bore the canopy,\nWith my extern the outward honouring,\nOr laid great bases for eternity,\nWhich proves more short than waste or ruining?\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favour\nLose all, and more by paying too much rent\nFor compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,\nPitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?\nNo, let me be obsequious in thy heart,\nAnd take thou my oblation, poor but free,\nWhich is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,\nBut mutual render, only me for thee.\n  Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul\n  When most impeached, stands least in thy control.\n\n\n                    126\n\nO thou my lovely boy who in thy power,\nDost hold Time’s fickle glass his fickle hour:\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show’st,\nThy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow’st.\nIf Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)\nAs thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\nShe keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\nMay time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.\nYet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,\nShe may detain, but not still keep her treasure!\n  Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,\n  And her quietus is to render thee.\n\n\n                    127\n\nIn the old age black was not counted fair,\nOr if it were it bore not beauty’s name:\nBut now is black beauty’s successive heir,\nAnd beauty slandered with a bastard shame,\nFor since each hand hath put on nature’s power,\nFairing the foul with art’s false borrowed face,\nSweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,\nBut is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.\nTherefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black,\nHer eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,\nAt such who not born fair no beauty lack,\nSlandering creation with a false esteem,\n  Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\n  That every tongue says beauty should look so.\n\n\n                    128\n\nHow oft when thou, my music, music play’st,\nUpon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\nWith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st\nThe wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\nDo I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\nTo kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\nWhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\nAt the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand.\nTo be so tickled they would change their state\nAnd situation with those dancing chips,\nO’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\nMaking dead wood more blest than living lips,\n  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,\n  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\n\n\n                    129\n\nTh’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame\nIs lust in action, and till action, lust\nIs perjured, murd’rous, bloody full of blame,\nSavage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,\nEnjoyed no sooner but despised straight,\nPast reason hunted, and no sooner had\nPast reason hated as a swallowed bait,\nOn purpose laid to make the taker mad.\nMad in pursuit and in possession so,\nHad, having, and in quest, to have extreme,\nA bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,\nBefore a joy proposed behind a dream.\n  All this the world well knows yet none knows well,\n  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\n\n\n                    130\n\nMy mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun,\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red,\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white,\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks,\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight,\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know,\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\nI grant I \u003cspan id=\"matchThe Sonnets15\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e saw a goddess go,\nMy mistress when she walks treads on the ground.\n  And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,\n  As any she belied with false compare.\n\n\n                    131\n\nThou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\nAs those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\nFor well thou know’st to my dear doting heart\nThou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\nYet in good faith some say that thee behold,\nThy face hath not the power to make love groan;\nTo say they err, I dare not be so bold,\nAlthough I swear it to my self alone.\nAnd to be sure that is not false I swear,\nA thousand groans but thinking on thy face,\nOne on another’s neck do witness bear\nThy black is fairest in my judgment’s place.\n  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\n  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.\n\n\n                    132\n\nThine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,\nKnowing thy heart torment me with disdain,\nHave put on black, and loving mourners be,\nLooking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\nAnd truly not the morning sun of heaven\nBetter becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\nNor that full star that ushers in the even\nDoth half that glory to the sober west\nAs those two mourning eyes become thy face:\nO let it then as well beseem thy heart\nTo mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\nAnd suit thy pity like in every part.\n  Then will I swear beauty herself is black,\n  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.\n\n\n                    133\n\nBeshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan\nFor that deep wound it gives my friend and me;\nIs’t not enough to torture me alone,\nBut slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?\nMe from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,\nAnd my next self thou harder hast engrossed,\nOf him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,\nA torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:\nPrison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward,\nBut then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail,\nWhoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,\nThou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.\n  And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,\n  Perforce am thine and all that is in me.\n\n\n                    134\n\nSo now I have confessed that he is thine,\nAnd I my self am mortgaged to thy will,\nMy self I’ll forfeit, so that other mine,\nThou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\nBut thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\nFor thou art covetous, and he is kind,\nHe learned but surety-like to write for me,\nUnder that bond that him as fist doth bind.\nThe statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\nThou usurer that put’st forth all to use,\nAnd sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,\nSo him I lose through my unkind abuse.\n  Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,\n  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\n\n\n                    135\n\nWhoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,\nAnd Will to boot, and Will in overplus,\nMore than enough am I that vex thee still,\nTo thy sweet will making addition thus.\nWilt thou whose will is large and spacious,\nNot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\nShall will in others seem right gracious,\nAnd in my will no fair acceptance shine?\nThe sea all water, yet receives rain still,\nAnd in abundance addeth to his store,\nSo thou being rich in will add to thy will\nOne will of mine to make thy large will more.\n  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,\n  Think all but one, and me in that one Will.\n\n\n                    136\n\nIf thy soul check thee that I come so near,\nSwear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,\nAnd will thy soul knows is admitted there,\nThus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.\nWill will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\nAy, fill it full with wills, and my will one,\nIn things of great receipt with case we prove,\nAmong a number one is reckoned none.\nThen in the number let me pass untold,\nThough in thy store’s account I one must be,\nFor nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,\nThat nothing me, a something sweet to thee.\n  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,\n  And then thou lov’st me for my name is Will.\n\n\n                    137\n\nThou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\nThat they behold and see not what they see?\nThey know what beauty is, see where it lies,\nYet what the best is, take the worst to be.\nIf eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,\nBe anchored in the bay where all men ride,\nWhy of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\nWhereto the judgment of my heart is tied?\nWhy should my heart think that a several plot,\nWhich my heart knows the wide world’s common place?\nOr mine eyes seeing this, say this is not\nTo put fair truth upon so foul a face?\n  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,\n  And to this false plague are they now transferred.\n\n\n                    138\n\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth,\nI do believe her though I know she lies,\nThat she might think me some untutored youth,\nUnlearned in the world’s false subtleties.\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\nAlthough she knows my days are past the best,\nSimply I credit her false-speaking tongue,\nOn both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:\nBut wherefore says she not she is unjust?\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\nO love’s best habit is in seeming trust,\nAnd age in love, loves not to have years told.\n  Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,\n  And in our faults by lies we flattered be.\n\n\n                    139\n\nO call not me to justify the wrong,\nThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart,\nWound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,\nUse power with power, and slay me not by art,\nTell me thou lov’st elsewhere; but in my sight,\nDear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,\nWhat need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might\nIs more than my o’erpressed defence can bide?\nLet me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,\nHer pretty looks have been mine enemies,\nAnd therefore from my face she turns my foes,\nThat they elsewhere might dart their injuries:\n  Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,\n  Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.\n\n\n                    140\n\nBe wise as thou art cruel, do not press\nMy tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:\nLest sorrow lend me words and words express,\nThe manner of my pity-wanting pain.\nIf I might teach thee wit better it were,\nThough not to love, yet love to tell me so,\nAs testy sick men when their deaths be near,\nNo news but health from their physicians know.\nFor if I should despair I should grow mad,\nAnd in my madness might speak ill of thee,\nNow this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,\nMad slanderers by mad ears believed be.\n  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,\n  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.\n\n\n                    141\n\nIn faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,\nFor they in thee a thousand errors note,\nBut ’tis my heart that loves what they despise,\nWho in despite of view is pleased to dote.\nNor are mine cars with thy tongue’s tune delighted,\nNor tender feeling to base touches prone,\nNor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\nTo any sensual feast with thee alone:\nBut my five wits, nor my five senses can\nDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\nWho leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\nThy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be:\n  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,\n  That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.\n\n\n                    142\n\nLove is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,\nHate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,\nO but with mine, compare thou thine own state,\nAnd thou shalt find it merits not reproving,\nOr if it do, not from those lips of thine,\nThat have profaned their scarlet ornaments,\nAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,\nRobbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.\nBe it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those,\nWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,\nRoot pity in thy heart that when it grows,\nThy pity may deserve to pitied be.\n  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,\n  By self-example mayst thou be denied.\n\n\n                    143\n\nLo as a careful huswife runs to catch,\nOne of her feathered creatures broke away,\nSets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch\nIn pursuit of the thing she would have stay:\nWhilst her neglected child holds her in chase,\nCries to catch her whose busy care is bent,\nTo follow that which flies before her face:\nNot prizing her poor infant’s discontent;\nSo run’st thou after that which flies from thee,\nWhilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,\nBut if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:\nAnd play the mother’s part, kiss me, be kind.\n  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,\n  If thou turn back and my loud crying still.\n\n\n                    144\n\nTwo loves I have of comfort and despair,\nWhich like two spirits do suggest me still,\nThe better angel is a man right fair:\nThe worser spirit a woman coloured ill.\nTo win me soon to hell my female evil,\nTempteth my better angel from my side,\nAnd would corrupt my saint to be a devil:\nWooing his purity with her foul pride.\nAnd whether that my angel be turned fiend,\nSuspect I may, yet not directly tell,\nBut being both from me both to each friend,\nI guess one angel in another’s hell.\n  Yet this shall I ne’er know but live in doubt,\n  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.\n\n\n                    145\n\nThose lips that Love’s own hand did make,\nBreathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate’,\nTo me that languished for her sake:\nBut when she saw my woeful state,\nStraight in her heart did mercy come,\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet,\nWas used in giving gentle doom:\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet:\n‘I hate’ she altered with an end,\nThat followed it as gentle day,\nDoth follow night who like a fiend\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away.\n  ‘I hate’, from hate away she threw,\n  And saved my life saying ‘not you’.\n\n\n                    146\n\nPoor soul the centre of my sinful earth,\nMy sinful earth these rebel powers array,\nWhy dost thou pine within and suffer dearth\nPainting thy outward walls so costly gay?\nWhy so large cost having so short a lease,\nDost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\nShall worms inheritors of this excess\nEat up thy charge? is this thy body’s end?\nThen soul live thou upon thy servant’s loss,\nAnd let that pine to aggravate thy store;\nBuy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\nWithin be fed, without be rich no more,\n  So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,\n  And death once dead, there’s no more dying then.\n\n\n                    147\n\nMy love is as a fever longing still,\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease,\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nTh’ uncertain sickly appetite to please:\nMy reason the physician to my love,\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve,\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now reason is past care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest,\nMy thoughts and my discourse as mad men’s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed.\n  For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\n  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.\n\n\n                    148\n\nO me! what eyes hath love put in my head,\nWhich have no correspondence with true sight,\nOr if they have, where is my judgment fled,\nThat censures falsely what they see aright?\nIf that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,\nWhat means the world to say it is not so?\nIf it be not, then love doth well denote,\nLove’s eye is not so true as all men’s: no,\nHow can it? O how can love’s eye be true,\nThat is so vexed with watching and with tears?\nNo marvel then though I mistake my view,\nThe sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.\n  O cunning love, with tears thou keep’st me blind,\n  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.\n\n\n                    149\n\nCanst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,\nWhen I against my self with thee partake?\nDo I not think on thee when I forgot\nAm of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?\nWho hateth thee that I do call my friend,\nOn whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon,\nNay if thou lour’st on me do I not spend\nRevenge upon my self with present moan?\nWhat merit do I in my self respect,\nThat is so proud thy service to despise,\nWhen all my best doth worship thy defect,\nCommanded by the motion of thine eyes?\n  But love hate on for now I know thy mind,\n  Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind.\n\n\n                    150\n\nO from what power hast thou this powerful might,\nWith insufficiency my heart to sway,\nTo make me give the lie to my true sight,\nAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?\nWhence hast thou this becoming of things ill,\nThat in the very refuse of thy deeds,\nThere is such strength and warrantise of skill,\nThat in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?\nWho taught thee how to make me love thee more,\nThe more I hear and see just cause of hate?\nO though I love what others do abhor,\nWith others thou shouldst not abhor my state.\n  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,\n  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.\n\n\n                    151\n\nLove is too young to know what conscience is,\nYet who knows not conscience is born of love?\nThen gentle cheater urge not my amiss,\nLest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.\nFor thou betraying me, I do betray\nMy nobler part to my gross body’s treason,\nMy soul doth tell my body that he may,\nTriumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,\nBut rising at thy name doth point out thee,\nAs his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,\nHe is contented thy poor drudge to be,\nTo stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\n  No want of conscience hold it that I call,\n  Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.\n\n\n                    152\n\nIn loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn,\nBut thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,\nIn act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,\nIn vowing new hate after new love bearing:\nBut why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,\nWhen I break twenty? I am perjured most,\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost.\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,\nAnd to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,\nOr made them swear against the thing they see.\n  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,\n  To swear against the truth so foul a be.\n\n\n                    153\n\nCupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,\nA maid of Dian’s this advantage found,\nAnd his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\nIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground:\nWhich borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\nA dateless lively heat still to endure,\nAnd grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,\nAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure:\nBut at my mistress’ eye Love’s brand new-fired,\nThe boy for trial needs would touch my breast,\nI sick withal the help of bath desired,\nAnd thither hied a sad distempered guest.\n  But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,\n  Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress’ eyes.\n\n\n                    154\n\nThe little Love-god lying once asleep,\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,\nCame tripping by, but in her maiden hand,\nThe fairest votary took up that fire,\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed,\nAnd so the general of hot desire,\nWas sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\nFor men discased, but I my mistress’ thrall,\n  Came there for cure and this by that I prove,\n  Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.\n\n\nTHE END",

Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\n\n Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in\n black.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must\nattend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in\nsubjection.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He\nthat so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his\nvirtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,\nrather than lack it where there is such abundance.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?\n\nLAFEW.\nHe hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath\npersecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process\nbut only the losing of hope by time.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage\n’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d\nso far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for\nlack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it\nwould be the death of the king’s disease.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be\nso: Gerard de Narbon.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him\nadmiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still,\nif knowledge could be set up against mortality.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\n\nLAFEW.\nA fistula, my lord.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI heard not of it before.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of\nGerard de Narbon?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those\nhopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind\ncarries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are\nvirtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance\nof her father \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well0\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows\ntakes all livelihood from her cheek.

Thy blood and virtue\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\nDo wrong to none.

Farewell, Bertram.\n\n [_Exit Countess._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nThe best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you!\n[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make\nmuch of her.\n\nLAFEW.\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]\n\nHELENA.\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\nI have forgot him; my imagination\nCarries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\nIf Bertram be away. ’Twere all one\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\nTh’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\nMust die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\nIn our heart’s table,—heart too capable\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\nBut now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\nYet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him\nThat they take place when virtue’s steely bones\nLooks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSave you, fair queen!\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you, monarch!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNo.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd no.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAre you meditating on virginity?\n\nHELENA.\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.\nMan is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\n\nPAROLLES.\nKeep him out.\n\nHELENA.\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet\nis weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow\nyou up.\n\nHELENA.\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no\nmilitary policy how virgins might blow up men?\n\nPAROLLES.\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in\nblowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your\ncity. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve\nvirginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well2\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nvirgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times\nfound; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.\nAway with it!\n\nHELENA.\nI will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To\nspeak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most\ninfallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity\nmurders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\nlimit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\nmites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\ndies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\nproud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within\nthe year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the\nprincipal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\n\nHELENA.\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n\nPAROLLES.\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a\ncommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less\nworth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly\nsuited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which\nwear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in\nyour cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our\nFrench wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a\nwither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear.\nWill you anything with it?\n\nHELENA.\nNot my virginity yet.\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\nThe court’s a learning-place; and he is one.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat one, i’ faith?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I wish well. ’Tis pity—\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat’s pity?\n\nHELENA.\nThat wishing well had not a body in’t\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\nAnd show what we alone must think, which \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well3\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nReturns us thanks.\n\n Enter a Page.\n\nPAGE.\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\n\n [_Exit Page._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at\ncourt.\n\nHELENA.\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUnder Mars, I.\n\nHELENA.\nI especially think, under Mars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy under Mars?\n\nHELENA.\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under\nMars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhen he was predominant.\n\nHELENA.\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy think you so?\n\nHELENA.\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat’s for advantage.\n\nHELENA.\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition\nthat your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and\nI like the wear well.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return\nperfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand\nwhat advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine\nunthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy\nfriends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So,\nfarewell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nHELENA.\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\nThe king’s disease,—my project may deceive me,\nBut my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.\n\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and\n others attending.\n\nKING.\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears;\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\nA braving war.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSo ’tis reported, sir.\n\nKING.\nNay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it,\nA certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\nTo have us make denial.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHis love and wisdom,\nApprov’d so to your majesty, may plead\nFor amplest credence.\n\nKING.\nHe hath arm’d our answer,\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\nTo stand on either part.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt well may serve\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\nFor breathing and exploit.\n\nKING.\nWhat’s he comes here?\n\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\nYoung Bertram.\n\nKING.\nYouth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\nHath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty’s.\n\nKING.\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\nInto the service of the time, and was\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\nHis equal had awak’d them, and his honour,\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\nException bid him speak, and at this time\nHis tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him\nHe us’d as creatures of another place,\nAnd bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,\nMaking them proud of his humility,\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\nBut goers backward.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHis good remembrance, sir,\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\nAs in your royal speech.\n\nKING.\nWould I were with him! He would always say,—\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\nHe scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them\nTo grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,”\nThis his good melancholy oft began\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\nWhen it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he,\n“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\nExpire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\nTo give some labourers room.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou’re lov’d, sir;\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\n\nKING.\nI fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,\nSince the physician at your father’s died?\nHe was much fam’d.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSome six months since, my lord.\n\nKING.\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;—\nLend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\nMy son’s no dearer.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThank your majesty.\n\n [_Exeunt. Flourish._]\n\nSCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found\nin the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty,\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\npublish them.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have\nheard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for\nI know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to\nmake such knaveries yours.\n\nCLOWN.\n’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, sir.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are\ndamned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world,\nIsbel the woman and I will do as we may.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\n\nCLOWN.\nI do beg your good will in this case.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn what case?\n\nCLOWN.\nIn Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I\nshall \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well4\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for\nthey say barnes are blessings.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\n\nCLOWN.\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he\nmust needs go that the devil drives.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIs this all your worship’s reason?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMay the world know them?\n\nCLOWN.\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood\nare; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s\nsake.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nY’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that\nfor me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and\ngives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He\nthat comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that\ncherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\nflesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my\nfriend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no\nfear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the\npapist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads\nare both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?\n\nCLOWN.\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\n   _For I the ballad will repeat,\n   Which men full true shall find;\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGet you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to\nspeak.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\n\nCLOWN.\n[_Sings._]\n_   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\n   Fond done, done fond,\n      Was this King Priam’s joy?\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n      And gave this sentence then:\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n     There’s yet one good in ten._\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\n\nCLOWN.\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would\nGod would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the\ntithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might\nhave a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake,\n’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he\npluck one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\n\nCLOWN.\nThat man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though\nhonesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the\nsurplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,\nforsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, now.\n\nSTEWARD.\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without\nother advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds;\nthere is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than\nshe’ll demand.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone\nshe was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;\nshe thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense.\nHer matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess,\nthat had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god,\nthat would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana\nno queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d,\nwithout rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she\ndeliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin\nexclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to\nknow it.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many\nlikelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the\nbalance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me;\nstall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will\nspeak with you further anon.\n\n [_Exit Steward._]\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\nIf ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\nIt is the show and seal of nature’s truth,\nWhere love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth.\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\nHer eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou know, Helen,\nI am a mother to you.\n\nHELENA.\nMine honourable mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNay, a mother.\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\nMethought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother,\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\nThat were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\nYou ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,\nYet I express to you a mother’s care.\nGod’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\nTo say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,\nThat this distempered messenger of wet,\nThe many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?\n—Why, that you are my daughter?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I am not.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI say, I am your mother.\n\nHELENA.\nPardon, madam;\nThe Count Rossillon cannot be my brother.\nI am from humble, he from honoured name;\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble,\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die.\nHe must not be my brother.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNor I your mother?\n\nHELENA.\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were—\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,—\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\nSo I were not his sister. Can’t no other,\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\nSo strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?\nMy fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\nYour salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross\nYou love my son; invention is asham’d,\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\nBut tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\nConfess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\nIf it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\nTo tell me truly.\n\nHELENA.\nGood madam, pardon me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you love my son?\n\nHELENA.\nYour pardon, noble mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nLove you my son?\n\nHELENA.\nDo not you love him, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGo not about; my love hath in’t a bond\nWhereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\nHave to the full appeach’d.\n\nHELENA.\nThen I confess,\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\nI love your son.\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love.\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\nThat he is lov’d of me; I follow him not\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\nYet \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well5\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e know how that desert should be.\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\nI still pour in the waters of my love\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\nReligious in mine error, I adore\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHad you not lately an intent,—speak truly,—\nTo go to Paris?\n\nHELENA.\nMadam, I had.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWherefore? tell true.\n\nHELENA.\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\nOf rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading\nAnd manifest experience had collected\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will’d me\nIn heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\nThere is a remedy, approv’d, set down,\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\nThe king is render’d lost.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis was your motive\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\n\nHELENA.\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\nHaply been absent then.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBut think you, Helen,\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\nHe would receive it? He and his physicians\nAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him;\nThey, that they cannot help. How shall they credit\nA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\nEmbowell’d of their doctrine, have let off\nThe danger to itself?\n\nHELENA.\nThere’s something in’t\nMore than my father’s skill, which was the great’st\nOf his profession, that his good receipt\nShall for my legacy be sanctified\nBy th’ luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour\nBut give me leave to try success, I’d venture\nThe well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure.\nBy such a day, an hour.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDost thou believe’t?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, madam, knowingly.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\nMeans and attendants, and my loving greetings\nTo those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home,\nAnd pray God’s blessing into thy attempt.\nBe gone tomorrow; and be sure of this,\nWhat I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I. Paris.

Farewell, young lords.\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,—\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\nOf the last monarchy—see that you come\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\n\nKING.\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\nThey say our French lack language to deny\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\nBefore you serve.\n\nBOTH.\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\n\nKING.\nFarewell.—Come hither to me.\n\n [_The King retires to a couch._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\n\nPAROLLES.\n’Tis not his fault; the spark.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, ’tis brave wars!\n\nPAROLLES.\nMost admirable!

Be more expressive to\nthem; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster\ntrue gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most\nreceiv’d star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be\nfollowed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I will do so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWorthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nPardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.\n\nKING.\nI’ll fee thee to stand up.\n\nLAFEW.\nThen here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon.\nI would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,\nAnd that at my bidding you could so stand up.\n\nKING.\nI would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\nAnd ask’d thee mercy for’t.\n\nLAFEW.\nGood faith, across;\nBut, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d\nOf your infirmity?\n\nKING.\nNo.\n\nLAFEW.\nO, will you eat\nNo grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will\nMy noble grapes, and if my royal fox\nCould reach them. I have seen a medicine\nThat’s able to breathe life into a stone,\nQuicken a rock, and make you dance canary\nWith sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch\nIs powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,\nTo give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand\nAnd write to her a love-line.\n\nKING.\nWhat ‘her’ is this?\n\nLAFEW.\nWhy, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d,\nIf you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,\nIf seriously I may convey my thoughts\nIn this my light deliverance, I have spoke\nWith one that in her sex, her years, profession,\nWisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more\nThan I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,\nFor that is her demand, and know her business?\nThat done, laugh well at me.\n\nKING.\nNow, good Lafew,\nBring in the admiration; that we with thee\nMay spend our wonder too, or take off thine\nBy wond’ring how thou took’st it.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, I’ll fit you,\nAnd not be all day neither.\n\n [_Exit Lafew._]\n\nKING.\nThus he his special nothing ever prologues.\n\n Enter Lafew with Helena.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\n\nKING.\nThis haste hath wings indeed.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\nThis is his majesty, say your mind to him.\nA traitor you do look like, but such traitors\nHis majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle,\nThat dare leave two together. Fare you well.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nKING.\nNow, fair one, does your business follow us?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, my good lord.\nGerard de Narbon was my father,\nIn what he did profess, well found.\n\nKING.\nI knew him.\n\nHELENA.\nThe rather will I spare my praises towards him.\nKnowing him is enough. On his bed of death\nMany receipts he gave me; chiefly one,\nWhich, as the dearest issue of his practice,\nAnd of his old experience the only darling,\nHe bade me store up as a triple eye,\nSafer than mine own two; more dear I have so,\nAnd hearing your high majesty is touch’d\nWith that malignant cause, wherein the honour\nOf my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,\nI come to tender it, and my appliance,\nWith all bound humbleness.\n\nKING.\nWe thank you, maiden,\nBut may not be so credulous of cure,\nWhen our most learned doctors leave us, and\nThe congregated college have concluded\nThat labouring art can \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well6\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e ransom nature\nFrom her inaidable estate. I say we must not\nSo stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,\nTo prostitute our past-cure malady\nTo empirics, or to dissever so\nOur great self and our credit, to esteem\nA senseless help, when help past sense we deem.\n\nHELENA.\nMy duty then shall pay me for my pains.\nI will no more enforce mine office on you,\nHumbly entreating from your royal thoughts\nA modest one to bear me back again.\n\nKING.\nI cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful.\nThou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give\nAs one near death to those that wish him live.\nBut what at full I know, thou know’st no part;\nI knowing all my peril, thou no art.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat I can do can do no hurt to try,\nSince you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.\nHe that of greatest works is finisher\nOft does them by the weakest minister.\nSo holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,\nWhen judges have been babes. Great floods have flown\nFrom simple sources, and great seas have dried\nWhen miracles have by the great’st been denied.\nOft expectation fails, and most oft there\nWhere most it promises; and oft it hits\nWhere hope is coldest, and despair most fits.\n\nKING.\nI must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.\nThy pains, not us’d, must by thyself be paid;\nProffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.\n\nHELENA.\nInspired merit so by breath is barr’d.\nIt is not so with Him that all things knows\nAs ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;\nBut most it is presumption in us when\nThe help of heaven we count the act of men.\nDear sir, to my endeavours give consent;\nOf heaven, not me, make an experiment.\nI am not an impostor, that proclaim\nMyself against the level of mine aim,\nBut know I think, and think I know most sure,\nMy art is not past power nor you past cure.\n\nKING.\nArt thou so confident?

Not helping, death’s my fee;\nBut if I help, what do you promise me?\n\nKING.\nMake thy demand.\n\nHELENA.\nBut will you make it even?\n\nKING.\nAy, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.\n\nHELENA.\nThen shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand\nWhat husband in thy power I will command:\nExempted be from me the arrogance\nTo choose from forth the royal blood of France,\nMy low and humble name to propagate\nWith any branch or image of thy state;\nBut such a one, thy vassal, whom I know\nIs free for me to ask, thee to bestow.\n\nKING.\nHere is my hand; the premises observ’d,\nThy will by my performance shall be serv’d;\nSo make the choice of thy own time, for I,\nThy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely.\nMore should I question thee, and more I must,\nThough more to know could not be more to trust:\nFrom whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest\nUnquestion’d welcome, and undoubted bless’d.\nGive me some help here, ho! If thou proceed\nAs high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\n\n Enter Countess and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nCome on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.\n\nCLOWN.\nI will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is\nbut to the court.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that\nwith such contempt? But to the court!\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it\noff at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand,\nand say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such\na fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have\nan answer will serve all men.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMarry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\n\nCLOWN.\nIt is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock,\nthe quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWill your answer serve fit to all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French\ncrown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a\npancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his\nhole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling\nknave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to\nhis skin.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any\nquestion.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth\nof it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a\ncourtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to\nbe the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of\nthem.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Spare not me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed\nyour ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer\nvery well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.\n\nCLOWN.\nI ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may\nserve long, but not serve ever.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily\nwith a fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nAn end, sir! To your business. Give Helen this,\nAnd urge her to a present answer back.\nCommend me to my kinsmen and my son.\nThis is not much.\n\nCLOWN.\nNot much commendation to them?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNot much employment for you. You understand me?\n\nCLOWN.\nMost fruitfully. I am there before my legs.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHaste you again.\n\n [_Exeunt severally._]\n\nSCENE III. Paris. The King’s palace.\n\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nThey say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to\nmake modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it\nthat we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming\nknowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our\nlatter times.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd so ’tis.\n\nLAFEW.\nTo be relinquish’d of the artists,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nSo I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.\n\nLAFEW.\nOf all the learned and authentic fellows,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nRight; so I say.\n\nLAFEW.\nThat gave him out incurable,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, there ’tis; so say I too.\n\nLAFEW.\nNot to be helped.\n\nPAROLLES.\nRight; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—\n\nLAFEW.\nUncertain life and sure death.\n\nPAROLLES.\nJust; you say well. So would I have said.\n\nLAFEW.\nI may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt is indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what\ndo you call there?\n\nLAFEW.\nA showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat’s it; I would have said the very same.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhy, your dolphin is not lustier; fore me, I speak in respect—\n\nPAROLLES.\nNay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious\nof it; and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge\nit to be the—\n\nLAFEW.\nVery hand of heaven.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, so I say.\n\nLAFEW.\nIn a most weak—\n\nPAROLLES.\nAnd debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should\nindeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the\nking, as to be—\n\nLAFEW.\nGenerally thankful.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.\n\n Enter King, Helena and Attendants.\n\nLAFEW.\nLustique, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I\nhave a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.\n\nPAROLLES.\n_Mor du vinager!_ is not this Helen?\n\nLAFEW.\nFore God, I think so.\n\nKING.\nGo, call before me all the lords in court.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nSit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side,\nAnd with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense\nThou has repeal’d, a second time receive\nThe confirmation of my promis’d gift,\nWhich but attends thy naming.\n\n Enter several Lords.\n\nFair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel\nOf noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,\nO’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice\nI have to use. Thy frank election make;\nThou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.\n\nHELENA.\nTo each of you one fair and virtuous mistress\nFall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!\n\nLAFEW.\nI’d give bay curtal and his furniture\nMy mouth no more were broken than these boys’,\nAnd writ as little beard.\n\nKING.\nPeruse them well.\nNot one of those but had a noble father.\n\n She addresses her to a Lord.\n\nHELENA.\nGentlemen,\nHeaven hath through me restor’d the king to health.\n\nALL.\nWe understand it, and thank heaven for you.\n\nHELENA.\nI am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest\nThat I protest I simply am a maid.\nPlease it, your majesty, I have done already.\nThe blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:\n“We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,\nLet the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,\nWe’ll ne’er come there again.”\n\nKING.\nMake choice; and, see,\nWho shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.\n\nHELENA.\nNow, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,\nAnd to imperial Love, that god most high,\nDo my sighs stream. [_To first Lord._] Sir, will you hear my suit?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAnd grant it.\n\nHELENA.\nThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\n\nLAFEW.\nI had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To second Lord._] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\nBefore I speak, too threat’ningly replies.\nLove make your fortunes twenty times above\nHer that so wishes, and her humble love!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNo better, if you please.\n\nHELENA.\nMy wish receive,\nWhich great Love grant; and so I take my leave.\n\nLAFEW.\nDo all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I’d have them whipp’d;\nor I would send them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To third Lord._] Be not afraid that I your hand should take;\nI’ll \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well7\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e do you wrong for your own sake.\nBlessing upon your vows, and in your bed\nFind fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\n\nLAFEW.\nThese boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are\nbastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To fourth Lord._] You are too young, too happy, and too good,\nTo make yourself a son out of my blood.\n\nFOURTH LORD.\nFair one, I think not so.\n\nLAFEW.\nThere’s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou\nbeest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.\n\nHELENA.\n[_To Bertram._] I dare not say I take you, but I give\nMe and my service, ever whilst I live,\nInto your guiding power. This is the man.\n\nKING.\nWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\nIn such a business give me leave to use\nThe help of mine own eyes.\n\nKING.\nKnow’st thou not, Bertram,\nWhat she has done for me?\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, my good lord,\nBut \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well8\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e hope to know why I should marry her.\n\nKING.\nThou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut follows it, my lord, to bring me down\nMust answer for your raising? I know her well;\nShe had her breeding at my father’s charge:\nA poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain\nRather corrupt me ever!\n\nKING.\n’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which\nI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\nOf colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,\nWould quite confound distinction, yet stands off\nIn differences so mighty. If she be\nAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st,\nA poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st—\nOf virtue for the name. But do not so.\nFrom lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\nThe place is dignified by the doer’s deed.\nWhere great additions swell’s, and virtue none,\nIt is a dropsied honour. Good alone\nIs good without a name; vileness is so:\nThe property by what it is should go,\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\nIn these to nature she’s immediate heir;\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn\nWhich challenges itself as honour’s born,\nAnd is not like the sire. Honours thrive\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\nThan our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave,\nDebauch’d on every tomb, on every grave\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\nWhere dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb\nOf honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\nI can create the rest. Virtue and she\nIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.\n\nKING.\nThou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\n\nHELENA.\nThat you are well restor’d, my lord, I am glad.\nLet the rest go.\n\nKING.\nMy honour’s at the stake, which to defeat,\nI must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\nWe please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;\nObey our will, which travails in thy good;\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\nLoosing upon thee in the name of justice,\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!\n\nBERTRAM.\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\nMy fancy to your eyes. When I consider\nWhat great creation, and what dole of honour\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\nIs as ’twere born so.\n\nKING.\nTake her by the hand,\nAnd tell her she is thine; to whom I promise\nA counterpoise; if not to thy estate,\nA balance more replete.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI take her hand.\n\nKING.\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\nAnd be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her,\nThy love’s to me religious; else, does err.\n\n [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]\n\nLAFEW.\nDo you hear, monsieur? A word with you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYour pleasure, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour lord and master did well to make his recantation.\n\nPAROLLES.\nRecantation! My lord! My master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAy. Is it not a language I speak?\n\nPAROLLES.\nA most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.\nMy master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAre you companion to the Count Rossillon?\n\nPAROLLES.\nTo any count; to all counts; to what is man.\n\nLAFEW.\nTo what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYou are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.\n\nLAFEW.\nI must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring\nthee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat I dare too well do, I dare not do.\n\nLAFEW.\nI did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou\ndidst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs\nand the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing\nthee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose\nthee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and\nthat thou art scarce worth.\n\nPAROLLES.\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—\n\nLAFEW.\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial;\nwhich if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of\nlattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look\nthrough thee. Give me thy hand.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you give me most egregious indignity.\n\nLAFEW.\nAy, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI have not, my lord, deserv’d it.\n\nLAFEW.\nYes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, I shall be wiser.\n\nLAFEW.\nEv’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’\ncontrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt\nfind what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my\nacquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the\ndefault, “He is a man I know.”\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for\ndoing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me\nleave.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old,\nfilthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of\nauthority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any\nconvenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more\npity of his age than I would have of—I’ll beat him, and if I could but\nmeet him again.\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nSirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you; you have\na new mistress.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of\nyour wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho? God?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nThe devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’\nthis fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou\nwert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if\nI were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a\ngeneral offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast\ncreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a\npomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more\nsaucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your\nbirth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word,\nelse I’d call you knave. I leave you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nPAROLLES.\nGood, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal’d\nawhile.\n\nBERTRAM.\nUndone, and forfeited to cares for ever!\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat’s the matter, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAlthough before the solemn priest I have sworn,\nI will not bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat, what, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nO my Parolles, they have married me!\nI’ll to the Tuscan wars, and \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well9\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nFrance is a dog-hole, and it no more merits\nThe tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!\n\nBERTRAM.\nThere’s letters from my mother; what th’ import is\nI know not yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars!\nHe wears his honour in a box unseen\nThat hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,\nSpending his manly marrow in her arms,\nWhich should sustain the bound and high curvet\nOf Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!\nFrance is a stable; we that dwell in’t, jades,\nTherefore, to th’ war!\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt shall be so; I’ll send her to my house,\nAcquaint my mother with my hate to her,\nAnd wherefore I am fled; write to the king\nThat which I durst not speak. His present gift\nShall furnish me to those Italian fields\nWhere noble fellows strike. War is no strife\nTo the dark house and the detested wife.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWill this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGo with me to my chamber and advise me.\nI’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow\nI’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard:\nA young man married is a man that’s marr’d.\nTherefore away, and leave her bravely; go.\nThe king has done you wrong; but hush ’tis so.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV.

But thanks be given, she’s very well, and wants\nnothing i’ the world; but yet she is not well.\n\nHELENA.\nIf she be very well, what does she ail that she’s not very well?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat two things?\n\nCLOWN.\nOne, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other,\nthat she’s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBless you, my fortunate lady!\n\nHELENA.\nI hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYou had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them\nstill. O, my knave how does my old lady?\n\nCLOWN.\nSo that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you\nsay.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, I say nothing.\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his\nmaster’s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and\nto have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a\nvery little of nothing.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAway! Thou art a knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is\nbefore me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.\n\nPAROLLES.\nGo to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nDid you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The\nsearch, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to\nthe world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.\n\nPAROLLES.\nA good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.\nMadam, my lord will go away tonight;\nA very serious business calls on him.\nThe great prerogative and right of love,\nWhich, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;\nBut puts it off to a compell’d restraint;\nWhose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets;\nWhich they distil now in the curbed time,\nTo make the coming hour o’erflow with joy\nAnd pleasure drown the brim.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat’s his will else?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat you will take your instant leave o’ the king,\nAnd make this haste as your own good proceeding,\nStrengthen’d with what apology you think\nMay make it probable need.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat more commands he?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat, having this obtain’d, you presently\nAttend his further pleasure.\n\nHELENA.\nIn everything I wait upon his will.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI shall report it so.\n\nHELENA.\nI pray you. Come, sirrah.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V.

Here he comes; I pray you make us friends; I\nwill pursue the amity\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\n[_To Bertram._] These things shall be done, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nPray you, sir, who’s his tailor?\n\nPAROLLES.\nSir!\n\nLAFEW.\nO, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a very good\ntailor.\n\nBERTRAM.\n[_Aside to Parolles._] Is she gone to the king?\n\nPAROLLES.\nShe is.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWill she away tonight?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAs you’ll have her.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,\nGiven order for our horses; and tonight,\nWhen I should take possession of the bride,\nEnd ere I do begin.\n\nLAFEW.\nA good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one\nthat lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand\nnothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.— God save you,\nCaptain.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIs there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know not how I have deserved to run into my lord’s displeasure.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou have made shift to run into ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him\nthat leapt into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again, rather\nthan suffer question for your residence.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt may be you have mistaken him, my lord.\n\nLAFEW.\nAnd shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers. Fare you well,\nmy lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernal in this light\nnut; the soul of this man is his clothes; trust him not in matter of\nheavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures.\nFarewell, monsieur; I have spoken better of you than you have or will\nto deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nAn idle lord, I swear.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI think so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, do you not know him?\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, I do know him well; and common speech\nGives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.\n\n Enter Helena.\n\nHELENA.\nI have, sir, as I was commanded from you,\nSpoke with the king, and have procur’d his leave\nFor present parting; only he desires\nSome private speech with you.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI shall obey his will.\nYou must not marvel, Helen, at my course,\nWhich holds not colour with the time, nor does\nThe ministration and required office\nOn my particular. Prepared I was not\nFor such a business; therefore am I found\nSo much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you;\nThat presently you take your way for home,\nAnd rather muse than ask why I entreat you:\nFor my respects are better than they seem;\nAnd my appointments have in them a need\nGreater than shows itself at the first view\nTo you that know them not. This to my mother.\n\n [_Giving a letter._]\n\n’Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so\nI leave you to your wisdom.\n\nHELENA.\nSir, I can nothing say\nBut that I am your most obedient servant.\n\nBERTRAM.\nCome, come, no more of that.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd ever shall\nWith true observance seek to eke out that\nWherein toward me my homely stars have fail’d\nTo equal my great fortune.\n\nBERTRAM.\nLet that go.\nMy haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.\n\nHELENA.\nPray, sir, your pardon.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWell, what would you say?\n\nHELENA.\nI am not worthy of the wealth I owe;\nNor dare I say ’tis mine, and yet it is;\nBut, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal\nWhat law does vouch mine own.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat would you have?\n\nHELENA.\nSomething; and scarce so much; nothing indeed.\nI would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes,\nStrangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.\n\nHELENA.\nI shall not break your bidding, good my lord.\nWhere are my other men, monsieur?\nFarewell,\n\n [_Exit Helena._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nGo thou toward home, where I will \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well10\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e come\nWhilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.\nAway, and for our flight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBravely, coragio!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE I.

Beware of them, Diana; their\npromises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust,\nare not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by\nthem; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck\nof maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they\nare limed with the twigs that threaten them.

Is’t not a handsome gentleman?\n\nHELENA.\nI like him well.\n\nDIANA.\n’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave\nThat leads him to these places. Were I his lady\nI would poison that vile rascal.\n\nHELENA.\nWhich is he?\n\nDIANA.\nThat jack-an-apes with scarfs.

This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nA pox on ’t; let it go; ’tis but a drum.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBut a drum! Is’t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent\ncommand, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend\nour own soldiers.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThat was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a\ndisaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had\nbeen there to command.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in\nthe loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt might have been recovered.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt might, but it is not now.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom\nattributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or\nanother, or _hic jacet_.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur, if you think your mystery\nin stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native\nquarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the\nattempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall\nboth speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,\neven to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI’ll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,\nencourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal\npreparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI know th’art valiant; and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will\nsubscribe for thee. Farewell.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI love not many words.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,\nthat so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is\nnot to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn’d than to\ndo’t.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou do not know him, my lord, as we do; certain it is that he will\nsteal himself into a man’s favour, and for a week escape a great deal\nof discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all of this, that so\nseriously he does address himself unto?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNone in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two\nor three probable lies; but we have almost embossed him; you shall see\nhis fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first\nsmok’d by the old Lord Lafew; when his disguise and he is parted, tell\nme what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very\nnight.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI must go look my twigs. He shall be caught.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYour brother, he shall go along with me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAs’t please your lordship. I’ll leave you.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNow will I lead you to the house, and show you\nThe lass I spoke of.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBut you say she’s honest.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThat’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once,\nAnd found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her\nBy this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind\nTokens and letters which she did re-send,\nAnd this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature;\nWill you go see her?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWith all my heart, my lord.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.\n\n Enter Helena and Widow.\n\nHELENA.\nIf you misdoubt me that I am not she,\nI know not how I shall assure you further,\nBut I shall lose the grounds I work upon.\n\nWIDOW.\nThough my estate be fall’n, I was well born,\nNothing acquainted with these businesses,\nAnd would not put my reputation now\nIn any staining act.\n\nHELENA.\nNor would I wish you.\nFirst give me trust, the count he is my husband,\nAnd what to your sworn counsel I have spoken\nIs so from word to word; and then you cannot,\nBy the good aid that I of you shall borrow,\nErr in bestowing it.\n\nWIDOW.\nI should believe you,\nFor you have show’d me that which well approves\nY’are great in fortune.\n\nHELENA.\nTake this purse of gold,\nAnd let me buy your friendly help thus far,\nWhich I will over-pay, and pay again\nWhen I have found it. The count he woos your daughter\nLays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\nResolv’d to carry her; let her in fine consent,\nAs we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.\nNow his important blood will naught deny\nThat she’ll demand; a ring the county wears,\nThat downward hath succeeded in his house\nFrom son to son, some four or five descents\nSince the first father wore it. This ring he holds\nIn most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,\nTo buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\nHowe’er repented after.\n\nWIDOW.\nNow I see\nThe bottom of your purpose.\n\nHELENA.\nYou see it lawful then; it is no more\nBut that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\nDesires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\nIn fine, delivers me to fill the time,\nHerself most chastely absent. After,\nTo marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns\nTo what is pass’d already.\n\nWIDOW.\nI have yielded.\nInstruct my daughter how she shall persever,\nThat time and place with this deceit so lawful\nMay prove coherent. Every night he comes\nWith musics of all sorts, and songs compos’d\nTo her unworthiness: it nothing steads us\nTo chide him from our eaves; for he persists\nAs if his life lay on ’t.\n\nHELENA.\nWhy then tonight\nLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,\nIs wicked meaning in a lawful deed,\nAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,\nWhere both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.\nBut let’s about it.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT IV.\n\nSCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.\n\n Enter first Lord with five or six Soldiers in ambush.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon\nhim, speak what terrible language you will; though you understand it\nnot yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him,\nunless someone among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nGood captain, let me be th’ interpreter.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nArt not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nNo sir, I warrant you.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBut what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nE’en such as you speak to me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe must think us some band of strangers i’ the adversary’s\nentertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages,\ntherefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what\nwe speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our\npurpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\ninterpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes;\nto beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies\nhe forges.\n\n Enter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\nTen o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home.\nWhat shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that\ncarries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d\ntoo often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart\nhath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the\nreports of my tongue.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was\nguilty of.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum,\nbeing not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such\npurpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit;\nyet slight ones will not carry it. They will say “Came you off with so\nlittle?” and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what’s the\ninstance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth, and buy\nmyself another of Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the\nbreaking of my Spanish sword.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] We cannot afford you so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] ’Twould not do.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Hardly serve.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThough I swore I leap’d from the window of the citadel,—\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] How deep?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThirty fathom.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would I had any drum of the enemy’s; I would swear I recover’d it.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[_Aside._] You shall hear one anon.\n\nPAROLLES.\nA drum now of the enemy’s!\n\n [_Alarum within._]\n\nFIRST LORD.\n_Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo._\n\nALL.\n_Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo._\n\n [_They seize and blindfold him._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nO, ransom, ransom!

Haply thou mayst inform\nSomething to save thy life.\n\nPAROLLES.\nO, let me live,\nAnd all the secrets of our camp I’ll show,\nTheir force, their purposes; nay, I’ll speak that\nWhich you will wonder at.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nBut wilt thou faithfully?\n\nPAROLLES.\nIf I do not, damn me.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n_Acordo linta._\nCome on; thou art granted space.\n\n [_Exit, with Parolles guarded._]\n\n A short alarum within.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGo tell the Count Rossillon and my brother\nWe have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled\nTill we do hear from them.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER.\nCaptain, I will.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n’A will betray us all unto ourselves;\nInform on that.\n\nSECOND SOLDIER.\nSo I will, sir.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nTill then I’ll keep him dark, and safely lock’d.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.\n\n Enter Bertram and Diana.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThey told me that your name was Fontybell.\n\nDIANA.\nNo, my good lord, Diana.\n\nBERTRAM.\nTitled goddess;\nAnd worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,\nIn your fine frame hath love no quality?\nIf the quick fire of youth light not your mind,\nYou are no maiden but a monument;\nWhen you are dead, you should be such a one\nAs you are now; for you are cold and stern,\nAnd now you should be as your mother was\nWhen your sweet self was got.\n\nDIANA.\nShe then was honest.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSo should you be.\n\nDIANA.\nNo.\nMy mother did but duty; such, my lord,\nAs you owe to your wife.\n\nBERTRAM.\nNo more a’ that!\nI pr’ythee do not strive against my vows;\nI was compell’d to her; but I love thee\nBy love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever\nDo thee all rights of service.\n\nDIANA.\nAy, so you serve us\nTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,\nYou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,\nAnd mock us with our bareness.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHow have I sworn?\n\nDIANA.\n’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\nBut the plain single vow that is vow’d true.\nWhat is not holy, that we swear not by,\nBut take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\nIf I should swear by Jove’s great attributes\nI lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths\nWhen I did love you ill? This has no holding,\nTo swear by him whom I protest to love\nThat I will work against him. Therefore your oaths\nAre words and poor conditions; but unseal’d,—\nAt least in my opinion.\n\nBERTRAM.\nChange it, change it.\nBe not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;\nAnd my integrity ne’er knew the crafts\nThat you do charge men with. Stand no more off,\nBut give thyself unto my sick desires,\nWho then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever\nMy love as it begins shall so persever.\n\nDIANA.\nI see that men make hopes in such a case,\nThat we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power\nTo give it from me.\n\nDIANA.\nWill you not, my lord?\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt is an honour ’longing to our house,\nBequeathed down from many ancestors,\nWhich were the greatest obloquy i’ the world\nIn me to lose.\n\nDIANA.\nMine honour’s such a ring;\nMy chastity’s the jewel of our house,\nBequeathed down from many ancestors,\nWhich were the greatest obloquy i’ the world\nIn me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom\nBrings in the champion honour on my part\nAgainst your vain assault.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHere, take my ring;\nMy house, mine honour, yea, my life be thine,\nAnd I’ll be bid by thee.\n\nDIANA.\nWhen midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;\nI’ll order take my mother shall not hear.\nNow will I charge you in the band of truth,\nWhen you have conquer’d my yet maiden-bed,\nRemain there but an hour, nor speak to me.\nMy reasons are most strong; and you shall know them\nWhen back again this ring shall be deliver’d;\nAnd on your finger in the night, I’ll put\nAnother ring, that what in time proceeds\nMay token to the future our past deeds.\nAdieu till then; then fail not. You have won\nA wife of me, though there my hope be done.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nDIANA.\nFor which live long to thank both heaven and me!\nYou may so in the end.\nMy mother told me just how he would woo,\nAs if she sat in’s heart. She says all men\nHave the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me\nWhen his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him\nWhen I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,\nMarry that will, I live and die a maid.\nOnly, in this disguise, I think’t no sin\nTo cozen him that would unjustly win.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. The Florentine camp.\n\n Enter the two French Lords and two or three Soldiers.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou have not given him his mother’s letter?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI have deliv’red it an hour since; there is something in’t that stings\nhis nature; for on the reading it, he chang’d almost into another man.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife\nand so sweet a lady.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nEspecially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king,\nwho had even tun’d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you\na thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWhen you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most\nchaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her\nhonour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made\nin the unchaste composition.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNow, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons,\nwe still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d\nends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in\nhis proper stream, o’erflows himself.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful\nintents? We shall not then have his company tonight?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThat approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company\nanatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein\nso curiously he had set this counterfeit.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the\nwhip of the other.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIn the meantime, what hear you of these wars?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWhat will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return\nagain into France?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nLet it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence\nis a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with\nmost austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a\ngroan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHow is this justified?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true,\neven to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be\nher office to say is come, was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of\nthe place.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHath the count all this intelligence?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAy, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full\narming of the verity.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great\ndignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be\nencountered with a shame as ample.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our\nvirtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes\nwould despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nHow now? Where’s your master?\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn\nleave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered\nhim letters of commendations to the king.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they\ncan commend.\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship\nnow. How now, my lord, is’t not after midnight?\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses, a month’s length apiece;\nby an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu\nwith his nearest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my lady\nmother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main\nparcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the\ngreatest, but that I have not ended yet.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIf the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure\nhence, it requires haste of your lordship.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter.\nBut shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,\nbring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a\ndouble-meaning prophesier.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBring him forth.\n\n [_Exeunt Soldiers._]\n\nHas sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.\n\nBERTRAM.\nNo matter; his heels have deserv’d it, in usurping his spurs so long.\nHow does he carry himself?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer\nyou as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her\nmilk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a\nfriar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster\nof his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?\n\nBERTRAM.\nNothing of me, has he?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your\nlordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to\nhear it.\n\n Enter Soldiers with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHe calls for the tortures. What will you say without ’em?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a\npasty I can say no more.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n_Bosko chimurcho._\n\nFIRST LORD.\n_Boblibindo chicurmurco._\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall\nask you out of a note.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAnd truly, as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n‘First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.’ What say you\nto that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are\nall scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation\nand credit, and as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nShall I set down your answer so?\n\nPAROLLES.\nDo. I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAll’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant\nmilitarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war\nin the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI will \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well16\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe\nhe can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\n‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set\ndown,—for I’ll speak truth.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe’s very near the truth in this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nPoor rogues, I pray you say.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous\npoor.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell\ntrue. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many;\nCorambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and\nGratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond,\nBentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and\nsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the\nwhich dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake\nthemselves to pieces.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat shall be done to him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what\ncredit I have with the duke.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain\nDumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the\nduke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he\nthinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt\nhim to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you know of it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories.\nDemand them singly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nDo you know this Captain Dumaine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know him: he was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was\nwhipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that\ncould not say him nay.\n\n [_First Lord lifts up his hand in anger._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are\nforfeit to the next tile that falls.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?\n\nPAROLLES.\nUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat is his reputation with the duke?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to\nme this other day to turn him out o’ the band. I think I have his\nletter in my pocket.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nMarry, we’ll search.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a\nfile, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHere ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI do not know if it be it or no.\n\nBERTRAM.\nOur interpreter does it well.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nExcellently.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[_Reads._] _Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold._\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a\nproper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of\none Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish.\nI pray you, sir, put it up again.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nNay, I’ll read it first by your favour.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid;\nfor I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is\na whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.\n\nBERTRAM.\nDamnable both sides rogue!\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[_Reads._]\n_When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\nAfter he scores, he \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well17\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e pays the score.\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\nHe ne’er pays after-debts, take it before.\nAnd say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this:\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;\nFor count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\nThine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,_\n                                     PAROLLES.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the\narmipotent soldier.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my\noffences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me\nlive, sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWe’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more\nto this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the\nduke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments\nhe parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking\nthem he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such\nvolubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his\nbest virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does\nlittle harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his\nconditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of\nhis honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what\nan honest man should have, he has nothing.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI begin to love him for this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nFor this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more\nand more a cat.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat say you to his expertness in war?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie\nhim I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that\ncountry he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called\nMile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man\nwhat honour I can, but of this I am not certain.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA pox on him! He’s a cat still.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHis qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold\nwill corrupt him to revolt.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation,\nthe inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a\nperpetual succession for it perpetually.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWhy does he ask him of me?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat’s he?\n\nPAROLLES.\nE’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in\ngoodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a\ncoward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a\nretreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.\n\nPAROLLES.\n[_Aside._] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem\nto deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious\nyoung boy the count, have I run into this danger: yet who would have\nsuspected an ambush where I was taken?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThere is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says you that\nhave so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such\npestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no\nhonest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.\n\nPAROLLES.\nO Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThat shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.\n\n [_Unmuffling him._]\n\nSo, look about you; know you any here?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGood morrow, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nGod bless you, Captain Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGod save you, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nCaptain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am for France.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGood Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana\nin behalf of the Count Rossillon? And I were not a very coward I’d\ncompel it of you; but fare you well.\n\n [_Exeunt Bertram, Lords \u0026c._]\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are undone, captain: all but your scarf; that has a knot on’t yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWho cannot be crushed with a plot?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf you could find out a country where but women were that had received\nso much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I\nam for France too; we shall speak of you there.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nYet am I thankful. If my heart were great\n’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more,\nBut I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft\nAs captain shall. Simply the thing I am\nShall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,\nLet him fear this; for it will come to pass\nThat every braggart shall be found an ass.\nRust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live\nSafest in shame; being fool’d, by foolery thrive.\nThere’s place and means for every man alive.\nI’ll after them.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE IV.

I duly am inform’d\nHis grace is at Marseilles; to which place\nWe have convenient convoy. You must know\nI am supposed dead. The army breaking,\nMy husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding,\nAnd by the leave of my good lord the king,\nWe’ll be before our welcome.\n\nWIDOW.\nGentle madam,\nYou \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well18\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e had a servant to whose trust\nYour business was more welcome.\n\nHELENA.\nNor you, mistress,\nEver a friend whose thoughts more truly labour\nTo recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven\nHath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,\nAs it hath fated her to be my motive\nAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts\nDefiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play\nWith what it loathes, for that which is away.\nBut more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\nUnder my poor instructions yet must suffer\nSomething in my behalf.\n\nDIANA.\nLet death and honesty\nGo with your impositions, I am yours\nUpon your will to suffer.\n\nHELENA.\nYet, I pray you;\nBut with the word the time will bring on summer,\nWhen briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,\nAnd be as sweet as sharp. We must away;\nOur waggon is prepar’d, and time revives us.\nAll’s well that ends well; still the fine’s the crown.\nWhate’er the course, the end is the renown.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\n\n Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there,\nwhose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy\nyouth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at\nthis hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by\nthat red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous\ngentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had\npartaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\n\nLAFEW.\n’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere\nwe light on such another herb.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the\nherb of grace.\n\nLAFEW.\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nA fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour distinction?\n\nCLOWN.\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\n\nLAFEW.\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\n\nCLOWN.\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n\nLAFEW.\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nAt your service.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you\nare.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho’s that? a Frenchman?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in\nFrance than there.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhat prince is that?\n\nCLOWN.\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\n\nLAFEW.\nHold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from\nthy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the\nmaster I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of\nthe world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with\nthe narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some\nthat humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender,\nand they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the\ngreat fire.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before,\nbecause I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be\nwell look’d to, without any tricks.\n\nCLOWN.\nIf I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks, which\nare their own right by the law of nature.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nLAFEW.\nA shrewd knave, and an unhappy.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSo he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him; by\nhis authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his\nsauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.\n\nLAFEW.\nI like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I\nheard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his\nreturn home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my\ndaughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a\nself-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d\nme to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against\nyour son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWith very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.\n\nLAFEW.\nHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he\nnumber’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that\nin such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters\nthat my son will be here tonight. I shall beseech your lordship to\nremain with me till they meet together.\n\nLAFEW.\nMadam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou need but plead your honourable privilege.\n\nLAFEW.\nLady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my God, it holds\nyet.\n\n Enter Clown.\n\nCLOWN.\nO madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on’s face;\nwhether there be a scar under’t or no, the velvet knows; but ’tis a\ngoodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a\nhalf, but his right cheek is worn bare.\n\nLAFEW.\nA scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so\nbelike is that.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut it is your carbonado’d face.\n\nLAFEW.\nLet us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the young noble\nsoldier.\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine hats, and most\ncourteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\nACT V.\n\nSCENE I.

In happy time;—\n\n Enter a Gentleman.\n\nThis man may help me to his majesty’s ear,\nIf he would spend his power. God save you, sir.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nAnd you.\n\nHELENA.\nSir, I have seen you in the court of France.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI have been sometimes there.\n\nHELENA.\nI do presume, sir, that you are not fallen\nFrom the report that goes upon your goodness;\nAnd therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,\nWhich lay nice manners by, I put you to\nThe use of your own virtues, for the which\nI shall continue thankful.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nWhat’s your will?\n\nHELENA.\nThat it will please you\nTo give this poor petition to the king,\nAnd aid me with that store of power you have\nTo come into his presence.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThe king’s not here.\n\nHELENA.\nNot here, sir?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nNot indeed.\nHe hence remov’d last night, and with more haste\nThan is his use.\n\nWIDOW.\nLord, how we lose our pains!\n\nHELENA.\nAll’s well that ends well yet,\nThough time seem so adverse and means unfit.\nI do beseech you, whither is he gone?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nMarry, as I take it, to Rossillon;\nWhither I am going.\n\nHELENA.\nI do beseech you, sir,\nSince you are like to see the king before me,\nCommend the paper to his gracious hand,\nWhich I presume shall render you no blame,\nBut rather make you thank your pains for it.\nI will come after you with what good speed\nOur means will make us means.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThis I’ll do for you.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you shall find yourself to be well thank’d,\nWhate’er falls more. We must to horse again.\nGo, go, provide.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rossillon.

I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune’s\nbuttering. Pr’ythee, allow the wind.\n\nPAROLLES.\nNay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I spake but by a metaphor.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against\nany man’s metaphor. Pr’ythee, get thee further.\n\nPAROLLES.\nPray you, sir, deliver me this paper.\n\nCLOWN.\nFoh, pr’ythee stand away. A paper from Fortune’s close-stool to give to\na nobleman! Look here he comes himself.\n\n Enter Lafew.\n\nHere is a pur of Fortune’s, sir, or of Fortune’s cat, but not a\nmusk-cat, that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure,\nand as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you\nmay, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally\nknave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him\nto your lordship.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch’d.\n\nLAFEW.\nAnd what would you have me to do? ’Tis too late to pare her nails now.\nWherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch\nyou, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive\nlong under her? There’s a quart d’ecu for you. Let the justices make\nyou and Fortune friends; I am for other business.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI beseech your honour to hear me one single word.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou beg a single penny more. Come, you shall ha’t; save your word.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy name, my good lord, is Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou beg more than word then. Cox my passion! Give me your hand. How\ndoes your drum?\n\nPAROLLES.\nO my good lord, you were the first that found me.\n\nLAFEW.\nWas I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring\nme out.\n\nLAFEW.\nOut upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of\nGod and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the other brings thee\nout.\n\n [_Trumpets sound._]\n\nThe king’s coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further\nafter me.

Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards \u0026c.\n\nKING.\nWe lost a jewel of her, and our esteem\nWas made much poorer by it; but your son,\nAs mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know\nHer estimation home.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n’Tis past, my liege,\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\nNatural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth,\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,\nO’erbears it and burns on.\n\nKING.\nMy honour’d lady,\nI have forgiven and forgotten all,\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\nAnd watch’d the time to shoot.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis I must say,—\nBut first, I beg my pardon,—the young lord\nDid to his majesty, his mother, and his lady,\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\nOf richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve\nHumbly call’d mistress.\n\nKING.\nPraising what is lost\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\nWe are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill\nAll repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\nAnd deeper than oblivion do we bury\nTh’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\nSo ’tis our will he should.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI shall, my liege.\n\n [_Exit Gentleman._]\n\nKING.\nWhat says he to your daughter?

I have letters sent me\nThat sets him high in fame.\n\n Enter Bertram.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe looks well on ’t.\n\nKING.\nI am not a day of season,\nFor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\nIn me at once. But to the brightest beams\nDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\nThe time is fair again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy high-repented blames\nDear sovereign, pardon to me.\n\nKING.\nAll is whole.\nNot one word more of the consumed time.\nLet’s take the instant by the forward top;\nFor we are old, and on our quick’st decrees\nTh’inaudible and noiseless foot of time\nSteals ere we can effect them. You remember\nThe daughter of this lord?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAdmiringly, my liege. At first\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\nDurst make too bold herald of my tongue:\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\nWhich warp’d the line of every other favour,\nScorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen,\nExtended or contracted all proportions\nTo a most hideous object. Thence it came\nThat she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself,\nSince I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye\nThe dust that did offend it.\n\nKING.\nWell excus’d:\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\nCrying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults\nMake trivial price of serious things we have,\nNot knowing them until we know their grave.\nOft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\nDestroy our friends, and after weep their dust:\nOur own love waking cries to see what’s done,\nWhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.\nBe this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.\nSend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.\nThe main consents are had, and here we’ll stay\nTo see our widower’s second marriage-day.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!\nOr, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!\n\nLAFEW.\nCome on, my son, in whom my house’s name\nMust be digested; give a favour from you,\nTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\nThat she may quickly come.\n\n [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]\n\nBy my old beard,\nAnd ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead\nWas a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\nThe last that e’er I took her leave at court,\nI saw upon her finger.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHers it was not.\n\nKING.\nNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\nWhile I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it.\nThis ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen\nI bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\nNecessitied to help, that by this token\nI would relieve her.

Noble she was, and thought\nI stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d\nTo mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully\nI could not answer in that course of honour\nAs she had made the overture, she ceas’d,\nIn heavy satisfaction, and would \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well21\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nReceive the ring again.\n\nKING.\nPlutus himself,\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\nHath not in nature’s mystery more science\nThan I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,\nWhoever gave it you. Then if you know\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\nConfess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\nYou got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety\nThat she would \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well22\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e put it from her finger\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\nWhere you have \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well23\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e come, or sent it us\nUpon her great disaster.\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well24\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e saw it.\n\nKING.\nThou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour,\nAnd mak’st conjectural fears to come into me\nWhich I would fain shut out.

What woman’s that?\n\n Enter Widow and Diana.\n\nDIANA.\nI am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,\nDerived from the ancient Capilet;\nMy suit, as I do understand, you know,\nAnd therefore know how far I may be pitied.\n\nWIDOW.\nI am her mother, sir, whose age and honour\nBoth suffer under this complaint we bring,\nAnd both shall cease, without your remedy.\n\nKING.\nCome hither, count; do you know these women?\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I neither can nor will deny\nBut that I know them. Do they charge me further?\n\nDIANA.\nWhy do you look so strange upon your wife?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe’s none of mine, my lord.\n\nDIANA.\nIf you shall marry,\nYou give away this hand, and that is mine,\nYou give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine,\nYou give away myself, which is known mine;\nFor I by vow am so embodied yours\nThat she which marries you must marry me,\nEither both or none.\n\nLAFEW.\n[_To Bertram_] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are\nno husband for her.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, this is a fond and desperate creature\nWhom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your highness\nLay a more noble thought upon mine honour\nThan for to think that I would sink it here.\n\nKING.\nSir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend\nTill your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour\nThan in my thought it lies!\n\nDIANA.\nGood my lord,\nAsk him upon his oath, if he does think\nHe had not my virginity.\n\nKING.\nWhat say’st thou to her?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe’s impudent, my lord,\nAnd was a common gamester to the camp.\n\nDIANA.\nHe does me wrong, my lord; if I were so\nHe might have bought me at a common price.\nDo not believe him. O, behold this ring,\nWhose high respect and rich validity\nDid lack a parallel; yet for all that\nHe gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,\nIf I be one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe blushes, and ’tis it.\nOf six preceding ancestors, that gem\nConferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue,\nHath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;\nThat ring’s a thousand proofs.\n\nKING.\nMethought you said\nYou saw one here in court could witness it.\n\nDIANA.\nI did, my lord, but loath am to produce\nSo bad an instrument; his name’s Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nI saw the man today, if man he be.\n\nKING.\nFind him, and bring him hither.\n\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat of him?\nHe’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,\nWith all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d:\nWhose nature sickens but to speak a truth.\nAm I or that or this for what he’ll utter,\nThat will speak anything?\n\nKING.\nShe hath that ring of yours.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her\nAnd boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth.\nShe knew her distance, and did angle for me,\nMadding my eagerness with her restraint,\nAs all impediments in fancy’s course\nAre motives of more fancy; and in fine,\nHer infinite cunning with her modern grace,\nSubdu’d me to her rate; she got the ring,\nAnd I had that which any inferior might\nAt market-price have bought.\n\nDIANA.\nI must be patient.\nYou that have turn’d off a first so noble wife\nMay justly diet me. I pray you yet,—\nSince you lack virtue, I will lose a husband—\nSend for your ring, I will return it home,\nAnd give me mine again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have it not.\n\nKING.\nWhat ring was yours, I pray you?\n\nDIANA.\nSir, much like\nThe same upon your finger.\n\nKING.\nKnow you this ring? This ring was his of late.\n\nDIANA.\nAnd this was it I gave him, being abed.\n\nKING.\nThe story then goes false you threw it him\nOut of a casement.\n\nDIANA.\nI have spoke the truth.\n\n Enter Attendant with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I do confess the ring was hers.\n\nKING.\nYou boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.\nIs this the man you speak of?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my lord.\n\nKING.\nTell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,\nNot fearing the displeasure of your master,\nWhich on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off,—\nBy him and by this woman here what know you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nSo please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman.\nTricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.\n\nKING.\nCome, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, he did love her; but how?\n\nKING.\nHow, I pray you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.\n\nKING.\nHow is that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.\n\nKING.\nAs thou art a knave and no knave.\nWhat an equivocal companion is this!\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.\n\nDIANA.\nDo you know he promised me marriage?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, I know more than I’ll speak.\n\nKING.\nBut wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?\n\nPAROLLES.\nYes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more\nthan that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of\nSatan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in\nthat credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed;\nand of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would\nderive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.\n\nKING.\nThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married;\nbut thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This\nring, you say, was yours?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you buy it? Or who gave it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not given me, nor I did not buy it.\n\nKING.\nWho lent it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not lent me neither.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you find it then?\n\nDIANA.\nI found it not.\n\nKING.\nIf it were yours by none of all these ways,\nHow could you give it him?\n\nDIANA.\nI \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well26\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e gave it him.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.\n\nKING.\nThis ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.\n\nDIANA.\nIt might be yours or hers for ought I know.\n\nKING.\nTake her away, I do not like her now.\nTo prison with her. And away with him.\nUnless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,\nThou diest within this hour.\n\nDIANA.\nI’ll \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well27\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e tell you.\n\nKING.\nTake her away.\n\nDIANA.\nI’ll put in bail, my liege.\n\nKING.\nI think thee now some common customer.\n\nDIANA.\nBy Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.\n\nKING.\nWherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?\n\nDIANA.\nBecause he’s guilty, and he is not guilty.\nHe knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t:\nI’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.\nGreat King, I am no strumpet, by my life;\nI am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.\n\n [_Pointing to Lafew._]\n\nKING.\nShe does abuse our ears; to prison with her.\n\nDIANA.\nGood mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;\n\n [_Exit Widow._]\n\nThe jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,\nAnd he shall surety me. But for this lord\nWho hath abus’d me as he knows himself,\nThough yet he \u003cspan id=\"matchAll's Well That Ends Well28\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e harm’d me, here I quit him.\nHe knows himself my bed he hath defil’d;\nAnd at that time he got his wife with child.\nDead though she be, she feels her young one kick;\nSo there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick,\nAnd now behold the meaning.\n\n Enter Widow with Helena.\n\nKING.\nIs there no exorcist\nBeguiles the truer office of mine eyes?\nIs’t real that I see?\n\nHELENA.\nNo, my good lord;\n’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,\nThe name, and not the thing.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBoth, both. O, pardon!\n\nHELENA.\nO, my good lord, when I was like this maid;\nI found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,\nAnd, look you, here’s your letter. This it says,\n‘When from my finger you can get this ring,\nAnd is by me with child, \u0026c.’ This is done;\nWill you be mine now you are doubly won?\n\nBERTRAM.\nIf she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,\nI’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\n\nHELENA.\nIf it appear not plain, and prove untrue,\nDeadly divorce step between me and you!\nO my dear mother, do I see you living?\n\nLAFEW.\nMine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon.\n[_to Parolles_] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.\nSo, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee.\nLet thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.\n\nKING.\nLet us from point to point this story know,\nTo make the even truth in pleasure flow.\n[_To Diana._] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,\nChoose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;\nFor I can guess that by thy honest aid,\nThou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.\nOf that and all the progress more and less,\nResolvedly more leisure shall express.\nAll yet seems well, and if it end so meet,\nThe bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.\n\n [_Flourish._]\n\n[EPILOGUE]\n\n_The king’s a beggar, now the play is done;\nAll is well ended if this suit be won,\nThat you express content; which we will pay\nWith strife to please you, day exceeding day.\nOurs be your patience then, and yours our parts;\nYour gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts._\n\n [_Exeunt omnes._]\n\n",

Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra’s palace.\n\n Enter Demetrius and Philo.\n\nPHILO.\nNay, but this dotage of our general’s\nO’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,\nThat o’er the files and musters of the war\nHave glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn\nThe office and devotion of their view\nUpon a tawny front. His captain’s heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of great fights hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper\nAnd is become the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gipsy’s lust.\n\n Flourish. Enter Antony and Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with\n Eunuchs fanning her.\n\nLook where they come:\nTake but good note, and you shall see in him\nThe triple pillar of the world transform’d\nInto a strumpet’s fool. Behold and see.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIf it be love indeed, tell me how much.\n\nANTONY.\nThere’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.\n\nANTONY.\nThen must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nNews, my good lord, from Rome.\n\nANTONY.\nGrates me, the sum.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, hear them, Antony.\nFulvia perchance is angry; or who knows\nIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent\nHis powerful mandate to you: “Do this or this;\nTake in that kingdom and enfranchise that.\nPerform’t, or else we damn thee.”\n\nANTONY.\nHow, my love?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPerchance! Nay, and most like.\nYou must not stay here longer; your dismission\nIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.\nWhere’s Fulvia’s process?—Caesar’s I would say? Both?\nCall in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,\nThou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine\nIs Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame\nWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!\n\nANTONY.\nLet Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\nOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.\nKingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike\nFeeds beast as man. The nobleness of life\nIs to do thus [_Embracing_]; when such a mutual pair\nAnd such a twain can do’t, in which I bind,\nOn pain of punishment, the world to weet\nWe stand up peerless.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nExcellent falsehood!\nWhy did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?\nI’ll seem the fool I am not. Antony\nWill be himself.\n\nANTONY.\nBut stirred by Cleopatra.\nNow, for the love of Love and her soft hours,\nLet’s not confound the time with conference harsh.\nThere’s not a minute of our lives should stretch\nWithout some pleasure now. What sport tonight?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHear the ambassadors.\n\nANTONY.\nFie, wrangling queen!\nWhom everything becomes—to chide, to laugh,\nTo weep; whose every passion fully strives\nTo make itself, in thee fair and admired!\nNo messenger but thine, and all alone\nTonight we’ll wander through the streets and note\nThe qualities of people. Come, my queen,\nLast night you did desire it. Speak not to us.\n\n [_Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra with the Train._]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nIs Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?\n\nPHILO.\nSir, sometimes when he is not Antony,\nHe comes too short of that great property\nWhich still should go with Antony.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI am full sorry\nThat he approves the common liar who\nThus speaks of him at Rome, but I will hope\nOf better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Alexandria. Another Room in Cleopatra’s palace.\n\n Enter Enobarbus, a Soothsayer, Charmian, Iras, Mardian and Alexas.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nLord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute\nAlexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ queen? O,\nthat I knew this husband which you say must charge his horns with\ngarlands!\n\nALEXAS.\nSoothsayer!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYour will?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIs this the man? Is’t you, sir, that know things?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nIn nature’s infinite book of secrecy\nA little I can read.\n\nALEXAS.\nShow him your hand.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBring in the banquet quickly; wine enough\nCleopatra’s health to drink.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood, sir, give me good fortune.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nI make not, but foresee.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nPray, then, foresee me one.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall be yet far fairer than you are.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHe means in flesh.\n\nIRAS.\nNo, you shall paint when you are old.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nWrinkles forbid!\n\nALEXAS.\nVex not his prescience. Be attentive.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHush!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall be more beloving than beloved.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nI had rather heat my liver with drinking.\n\nALEXAS.\nNay, hear him.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a\nforenoon and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom\nHerod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar,\nand companion me with my mistress.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou shall outlive the lady whom you serve.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO, excellent! I love long life better than figs.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYou have seen and proved a fairer former fortune\nThan that which is to approach.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nThen belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and\nwenches must I have?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nIf every of your wishes had a womb,\nAnd fertile every wish, a million.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nOut, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.\n\nALEXAS.\nYou think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNay, come, tell Iras hers.\n\nALEXAS.\nWe’ll know all our fortunes.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nMine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to bed.\n\nIRAS.\nThere’s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nE’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine.\n\nIRAS.\nGo, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot\nscratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but workaday fortune.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nYour fortunes are alike.\n\nIRAS.\nBut how, but how? give me particulars.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nI have said.\n\nIRAS.\nAm I not an inch of fortune better than she?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nWell, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you\nchoose it?\n\nIRAS.\nNot in my husband’s nose.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nOur worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas—come, his fortune! his\nfortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech\nthee, and let her die too, and give him a worse, and let worse follow\nworse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave,\nfiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny\nme a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!\n\nIRAS.\nAmen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a\nheartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly\nsorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep\ndecorum and fortune him accordingly!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nAmen.\n\nALEXAS.\nLo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make\nthemselves whores but they’d do’t!\n\n Enter Cleopatra.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHush, Here comes Antony.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNot he, the queen.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSaw you my lord?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo, lady.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWas he not here?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNo, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden\nA Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nMadam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSeek him and bring him hither. Where’s Alexas?\n\nALEXAS.\nHere, at your service. My lord approaches.\n\n Enter Antony with a Messenger.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWe will not look upon him. Go with us.\n\n [_Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas and\n Soothsayer._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife first came into the field.\n\nANTONY.\nAgainst my brother Lucius.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAy.\nBut soon that war had end, and the time’s state\nMade friends of them, jointing their force ’gainst Caesar,\nWhose better issue in the war from Italy\nUpon the first encounter drave them.\n\nANTONY.\nWell, what worst?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe nature of bad news infects the teller.\n\nANTONY.\nWhen it concerns the fool or coward. On.\nThings that are past are done with me. ’Tis thus:\nWho tells me true, though in his tale lie death,\nI hear him as he flattered.\n\nMESSENGER.\nLabienus—\nThis is stiff news—hath with his Parthian force\nExtended Asia from Euphrates\nHis conquering banner shook from Syria\nTo Lydia and to Ionia,\nWhilst—\n\nANTONY.\n“Antony”, thou wouldst say—\n\nMESSENGER.\nO, my lord!\n\nANTONY.\nSpeak to me home; mince not the general tongue.\nName Cleopatra as she is called in Rome;\nRail thou in Fulvia’s phrase, and taunt my faults\nWith such full licence as both truth and malice\nHave power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds\nWhen our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us\nIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAt your noble pleasure.\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\n Enter another Messenger.\n\nANTONY.\nFrom Sicyon, ho, the news? Speak there!\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nThe man from Sicyon—\n\nANTONY.\nIs there such a one?\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nHe stays upon your will.\n\nANTONY.\nLet him appear.\n\n [_Exit second Messenger._]\n\nThese strong Egyptian fetters I must break,\nOr lose myself in dotage.\n\n Enter another Messenger with a letter.\n\nWhat are you?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife is dead.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere died she?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nIn Sicyon:\nHer length of sickness, with what else more serious\nImporteth thee to know, this bears.\n\n [_Gives a letter._]\n\nANTONY.\nForbear me.\n\n [_Exit third Messenger._]\n\nThere’s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.\nWhat our contempts doth often hurl from us,\nWe wish it ours again. The present pleasure,\nBy revolution lowering, does become\nThe opposite of itself. She’s good, being gone.\nThe hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.\nI must from this enchanting queen break off.\nTen thousand harms, more than the ills I know,\nMy idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!\n\n Enter Enobarbus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat’s your pleasure, sir?\n\nANTONY.\nI must with haste from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to\nthem. If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.\n\nANTONY.\nI must be gone.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUnder a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them\naway for nothing, though, between them and a great cause they should be\nesteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies\ninstantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I\ndo think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon\nher, she hath such a celerity in dying.\n\nANTONY.\nShe is cunning past man’s thought.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAlack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of\npure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they\nare greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot\nbe cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as\nJove.\n\nANTONY.\nWould I had \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra0\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e seen her!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nO, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not\nto have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSir?\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nFulvia?\n\nANTONY.\nDead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their\ndeities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors\nof the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out,\nthere are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia,\nthen had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is\ncrowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat:\nand indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.\n\nANTONY.\nThe business she hath broached in the state\nCannot endure my absence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd the business you have broached here cannot be without you,\nespecially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.\n\nANTONY.\nNo more light answers. Let our officers\nHave notice what we purpose. I shall break\nThe cause of our expedience to the Queen,\nAnd get her leave to part. For not alone\nThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,\nDo strongly speak to us, but the letters too\nOf many our contriving friends in Rome\nPetition us at home. Sextus Pompeius\nHath given the dare to Caesar, and commands\nThe empire of the sea. Our slippery people,\nWhose love is \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra1\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e linked to the deserver\nTill his deserts are past, begin to throw\nPompey the Great and all his dignities\nUpon his son, who, high in name and power,\nHigher than both in blood and life, stands up\nFor the main soldier; whose quality, going on,\nThe sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding\nWhich, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life\nAnd not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure\nTo such whose place is under us, requires\nOur quick remove from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall do’t.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra’s palace.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere is he?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nI did not see him since.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSee where he is, who’s with him, what he does.\nI did not send you. If you find him sad,\nSay I am dancing; if in mirth, report\nThat I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.\n\n [_Exit Alexas._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,\nYou do not hold the method to enforce\nThe like from him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat should I do I do not?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIn each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nTempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear.\nIn time we hate that which we often fear.\nBut here comes Antony.\n\n Enter Antony.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am sick and sullen.\n\nANTONY.\nI am sorry to give breathing to my purpose—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHelp me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.\nIt cannot be thus long; the sides of nature\nWill not sustain it.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, my dearest queen—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPray you, stand farther from me.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI know by that same eye there’s some good news.\nWhat, says the married woman you may go?\nWould she had \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra2\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e given you leave to come!\nLet her not say ’tis I that keep you here.\nI have no power upon you; hers you are.\n\nANTONY.\nThe gods best know—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra3\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e was there queen\nSo mightily betrayed! Yet at the first\nI saw the treasons planted.\n\nANTONY.\nCleopatra—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy should I think you can be mine and true,\nThough you in swearing shake the throned gods,\nWho have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,\nTo be entangled with those mouth-made vows\nWhich break themselves in swearing!\n\nANTONY.\nMost sweet queen—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, pray you seek no colour for your going,\nBut bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,\nThen was the time for words. No going then,\nEternity was in our lips and eyes,\nBliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor\nBut was a race of heaven. They are so still,\nOr thou, the greatest soldier of the world,\nArt turned the greatest liar.\n\nANTONY.\nHow now, lady!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know\nThere were a heart in Egypt.\n\nANTONY.\nHear me, queen:\nThe strong necessity of time commands\nOur services awhile, but my full heart\nRemains in use with you. Our Italy\nShines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius\nMakes his approaches to the port of Rome;\nEquality of two domestic powers\nBreed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,\nAre newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,\nRich in his father’s honour, creeps apace\nInto the hearts of such as have not thrived\nUpon the present state, whose numbers threaten;\nAnd quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge\nBy any desperate change. My more particular,\nAnd that which most with you should safe my going,\nIs Fulvia’s death.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThough age from folly could not give me freedom,\nIt does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?\n\nANTONY.\nShe’s dead, my queen.\nLook here, and at thy sovereign leisure read\nThe garboils she awaked; at the last, best,\nSee when and where she died.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO most false love!\nWhere be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill\nWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,\nIn Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.\n\nANTONY.\nQuarrel no more, but be prepared to know\nThe purposes I bear; which are, or cease,\nAs you shall give th’ advice. By the fire\nThat quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence\nThy soldier, servant, making peace or war\nAs thou affects.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCut my lace, Charmian, come!\nBut let it be; I am quickly ill and well,\nSo Antony loves.\n\nANTONY.\nMy precious queen, forbear,\nAnd give true evidence to his love, which stands\nAn honourable trial.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSo Fulvia told me.\nI prithee, turn aside and weep for her,\nThen bid adieu to me, and say the tears\nBelong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene\nOf excellent dissembling, and let it look\nLike perfect honour.\n\nANTONY.\nYou’ll heat my blood. No more.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYou can do better yet, but this is meetly.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, by my sword—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd target. Still he mends.\nBut this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,\nHow this Herculean Roman does become\nThe carriage of his chafe.\n\nANTONY.\nI’ll leave you, lady.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCourteous lord, one word.\nSir, you and I must part, but that’s not it;\nSir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it;\nThat you know well. Something it is I would—\nO, my oblivion is a very Antony,\nAnd I am all forgotten.\n\nANTONY.\nBut that your royalty\nHolds idleness your subject, I should take you\nFor idleness itself.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\n’Tis sweating labour\nTo bear such idleness so near the heart\nAs Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,\nSince my becomings kill me when they do not\nEye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;\nTherefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,\nAnd all the gods go with you! Upon your sword\nSit laurel victory, and smooth success\nBe strewed before your feet!\n\nANTONY.\nLet us go. Come.\nOur separation so abides and flies\nThat thou, residing here, goes yet with me,\nAnd I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.\nAway!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Rome. An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\n\n Enter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\nThat all men follow.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nI must not think there are\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\nThan what he chooses.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHere’s more news.\n\nMESSENGER.\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\nGive him much wronged.\n\nCAESAR.\nI should have known no less.\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\nTo rot itself with motion.\n\n Enter a second Messenger.\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nCaesar, I bring thee word\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\nThan could his war resisted.\n\nCAESAR.\nAntony,\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\nSo much as lanked not.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis pity of him.\n\nCAESAR.\nLet his shames quickly\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\nThrives in our idleness.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTomorrow, Caesar,\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\nTo front this present time.\n\nCAESAR.\nTill which encounter\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nFarewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime\nOf stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,\nTo let me be partaker.\n\nCAESAR.\nDoubt not, sir.\nI knew it for my bond.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and Mardian.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCharmian!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHa, ha!\nGive me to drink mandragora.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nWhy, madam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat I might sleep out this great gap of time\nMy Antony is away.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nYou think of him too much.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, ’tis treason!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam, I trust not so.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThou, eunuch Mardian!\n\nMARDIAN.\nWhat’s your highness’ pleasure?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNot now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure\nIn aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee\nThat, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts\nMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?\n\nMARDIAN.\nYes, gracious madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIndeed?\n\nMARDIAN.\nNot in deed, madam, for I can do nothing\nBut what indeed is honest to be done.\nYet have I fierce affections, and think\nWhat Venus did with Mars.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, Charmian,\nWhere think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?\nOr does he walk? Or is he on his horse?\nO happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\nDo bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?\nThe demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\nAnd burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,\nOr murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”\nFor so he calls me. Now I feed myself\nWith most delicious poison. Think on me\nThat am with Phœbus’ amorous pinches black,\nAnd wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\nWhen thou wast here above the ground, I was\nA morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey\nWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;\nThere would he anchor his aspect, and die\nWith looking on his life.\n\n Enter Alexas.\n\nALEXAS.\nSovereign of Egypt, hail!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHow much unlike art thou Mark Antony!\nYet, coming from him, that great medicine hath\nWith his tinct gilded thee.\nHow goes it with my brave Mark Antony?\n\nALEXAS.\nLast thing he did, dear queen,\nHe kissed—the last of many doubled kisses—\nThis orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMine ear must pluck it thence.\n\nALEXAS.\n“Good friend,” quoth he,\n“Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends\nThis treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,\nTo mend the petty present, I will piece\nHer opulent throne with kingdoms. All the east,\nSay thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded\nAnd soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,\nWho neighed so high that what I would have spoke\nWas beastly dumbed by him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, was he sad or merry?\n\nALEXAS.\nLike to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes\nOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO well-divided disposition!—Note him,\nNote him, good Charmian, ’tis the man; but note him:\nHe was not sad, for he would shine on those\nThat make their looks by his; he was not merry,\nWhich seemed to tell them his remembrance lay\nIn Egypt with his joy; but between both.\nO heavenly mingle!—Be’st thou sad or merry,\nThe violence of either thee becomes,\nSo does it no man else.—Met’st thou my posts?\n\nALEXAS.\nAy, madam, twenty several messengers.\nWhy do you send so thick?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWho’s born that day\nWhen I forget to send to Antony\nShall die a beggar.—Ink and paper, Charmian.—\nWelcome, my good Alexas.—Did I, Charmian,\nEver love Caesar so?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO that brave Caesar!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBe choked with such another emphasis!\nSay “the brave Antony.”\n\nCHARMIAN.\nThe valiant Caesar!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBy Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth\nIf thou with Caesar paragon again\nMy man of men.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nBy your most gracious pardon,\nI sing but after you.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy salad days,\nWhen I was green in judgment, cold in blood,\nTo say as I said then. But come, away,\nGet me ink and paper.\nHe shall have every day a several greeting,\nOr I’ll unpeople Egypt.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nSCENE I. Messina. A Room in Pompey’s house.\n\n Enter Pompey, Menecrates and Menas in warlike manner.\n\nPOMPEY.\nIf the great gods be just, they shall assist\nThe deeds of justest men.\n\nMENECRATES.\nKnow, worthy Pompey,\nThat what they do delay they not deny.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhiles we are suitors to their throne, decays\nThe thing we sue for.\n\nMENECRATES.\nWe, ignorant of ourselves,\nBeg often our own harms, which the wise powers\nDeny us for our good; so find we profit\nBy losing of our prayers.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI shall do well.\nThe people love me, and the sea is mine;\nMy powers are crescent, and my auguring hope\nSays it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony\nIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will make\nNo wars without doors. Caesar gets money where\nHe loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,\nOf both is flattered; but he neither loves\nNor either cares for him.\n\nMENAS.\nCaesar and Lepidus\nAre in the field. A mighty strength they carry.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhere have you this? ’Tis false.\n\nMENAS.\nFrom Silvius, sir.\n\nPOMPEY.\nHe dreams. I know they are in Rome together,\nLooking for Antony. But all the charms of love,\nSalt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!\nLet witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;\nTie up the libertine in a field of feasts;\nKeep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks\nSharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,\nThat sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour\nEven till a Lethe’d dullness—\n\n Enter Varrius.\n\nHow now, Varrius!\n\nVARRIUS.\nThis is most certain that I shall deliver:\nMark Antony is every hour in Rome\nExpected. Since he went from Egypt ’tis\nA space for farther travel.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI could have given less matter\nA better ear.—Menas, I did not think\nThis amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm\nFor such a petty war. His soldiership\nIs twice the other twain. But let us rear\nThe higher our opinion, that our stirring\nCan from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck\nThe ne’er lust-wearied Antony.\n\nMENAS.\nI cannot hope\nCaesar and Antony shall well greet together.\nHis wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar;\nHis brother warred upon him, although I think,\nNot moved by Antony.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI know not, Menas,\nHow lesser enmities may give way to greater.\nWere’t not that we stand up against them all,\n’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,\nFor they have entertained cause enough\nTo draw their swords. But how the fear of us\nMay cement their divisions, and bind up\nThe petty difference, we yet not know.\nBe’t as our gods will have’t! It only stands\nOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.\nCome, Menas.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rome. A Room in the House of Lepidus.\n\n Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nGood Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed,\nAnd shall become you well, to entreat your captain\nTo soft and gentle speech.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall entreat him\nTo answer like himself. If Caesar move him,\nLet Antony look over Caesar’s head\nAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,\nWere I the wearer of Antonius’ beard,\nI would not shave’t today.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis not a time\nFor private stomaching.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nEvery time\nServes for the matter that is then born in’t.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nBut small to greater matters must give way.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot if the small come first.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour speech is passion;\nBut pray you stir no embers up. Here comes\nThe noble Antony.\n\n Enter Antony and Ventidius.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd yonder Caesar.\n\n Enter Caesar, Maecenas and Agrippa.\n\nANTONY.\nIf we compose well here, to Parthia.\nHark, Ventidius.\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble friends,\nThat which combined us was most great, and let not\nA leaner action rend us. What’s amiss,\nMay it be gently heard. When we debate\nOur trivial difference loud, we do commit\nMurder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,\nThe rather for I earnestly beseech,\nTouch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,\nNor curstness grow to th’ matter.\n\nANTONY.\n’Tis spoken well.\nWere we before our armies, and to fight,\nI should do thus.\n\nCAESAR.\nWelcome to Rome.\n\nANTONY.\nThank you.\n\nCAESAR.\nSit.\n\nANTONY.\nSit, sir.\n\nCAESAR.\nNay, then.\n\nANTONY.\nI learn you take things ill which are not so,\nOr being, concern you not.\n\nCAESAR.\nI must be laughed at\nIf, or for nothing or a little, I\nShould say myself offended, and with you\nChiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at that I should\nOnce name you derogately when to sound your name\nIt not concerned me.\n\nANTONY.\nMy being in Egypt, Caesar,\nWhat was’t to you?\n\nCAESAR.\nNo more than my residing here at Rome\nMight be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there\nDid practise on my state, your being in Egypt\nMight be my question.\n\nANTONY.\nHow intend you, practised?\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may be pleased to catch at mine intent\nBy what did here befall me. Your wife and brother\nMade wars upon me, and their contestation\nWas theme for you; you were the word of war.\n\nANTONY.\nYou do mistake your business. My brother \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra4\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nDid urge me in his act. I did inquire it,\nAnd have my learning from some true reports\nThat drew their swords with you. Did he not rather\nDiscredit my authority with yours,\nAnd make the wars alike against my stomach,\nHaving alike your cause? Of this my letters\nBefore did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,\nAs matter whole you have not to make it with,\nIt must not be with this.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou praise yourself\nBy laying defects of judgment to me; but\nYou patched up your excuses.\n\nANTONY.\nNot so, not so.\nI know you could not lack—I am certain on’t—\nVery necessity of this thought, that I,\nYour partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,\nCould not with graceful eyes attend those wars\nWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,\nI would you had her spirit in such another.\nThe third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle\nYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWould we had all such wives, that the men\nMight go to wars with the women.\n\nANTONY.\nSo much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,\nMade out of her impatience—which not wanted\nShrewdness of policy too—I grieving grant\nDid you too much disquiet. For that you must\nBut say I could not help it.\n\nCAESAR.\nI wrote to you\nWhen rioting in Alexandria; you\nDid pocket up my letters, and with taunts\nDid gibe my missive out of audience.\n\nANTONY.\nSir,\nHe fell upon me ere admitted, then.\nThree kings I had newly feasted, and did want\nOf what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day\nI told him of myself, which was as much\nAs to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow\nBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,\nOut of our question wipe him.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou have broken\nThe article of your oath, which you shall \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra5\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nHave tongue to charge me with.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nSoft, Caesar!\n\nANTONY.\nNo, Lepidus, let him speak.\nThe honour is sacred which he talks on now,\nSupposing that I lacked it. But on, Caesar:\nThe article of my oath?\n\nCAESAR.\nTo lend me arms and aid when I required them,\nThe which you both denied.\n\nANTONY.\nNeglected, rather;\nAnd then when poisoned hours had bound me up\nFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may\nI’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty\nShall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\nWork without it. Truth is that Fulvia,\nTo have me out of Egypt, made wars here,\nFor which myself, the ignorant motive, do\nSo far ask pardon as befits mine honour\nTo stoop in such a case.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis noble spoken.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf it might please you to enforce no further\nThe griefs between ye; to forget them quite\nWere to remember that the present need\nSpeaks to atone you.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWorthily spoken, Maecenas.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nOr, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you\nhear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to\nwrangle in when you have nothing else to do.\n\nANTONY.\nThou art a soldier only. Speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThat truth should be silent I had almost forgot.\n\nANTONY.\nYou wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nGo to, then. Your considerate stone!\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not much dislike the matter, but\nThe manner of his speech; for’t cannot be\nWe shall remain in friendship, our conditions\nSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knew\nWhat hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge\nO’ th’ world I would pursue it.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGive me leave, Caesar.\n\nCAESAR.\nSpeak, Agrippa.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThou hast a sister by the mother’s side,\nAdmired Octavia. Great Mark Antony\nIs now a widower.\n\nCAESAR.\nSay not so, Agrippa.\nIf Cleopatra heard you, your reproof\nWere well deserved of rashness.\n\nANTONY.\nI am not married, Caesar. Let me hear\nAgrippa further speak.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nTo hold you in perpetual amity,\nTo make you brothers, and to knit your hearts\nWith an unslipping knot, take Antony\nOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claims\nNo worse a husband than the best of men;\nWhose virtue and whose general graces speak\nThat which none else can utter. By this marriage\nAll little jealousies, which now seem great,\nAnd all great fears, which now import their dangers,\nWould then be nothing. Truths would be tales,\nWhere now half-tales be truths. Her love to both\nWould each to other, and all loves to both,\nDraw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,\nFor ’tis a studied, not a present thought,\nBy duty ruminated.\n\nANTONY.\nWill Caesar speak?\n\nCAESAR.\nNot till he hears how Antony is touched\nWith what is spoke already.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat power is in Agrippa,\nIf I would say “Agrippa, be it so,”\nTo make this good?\n\nCAESAR.\nThe power of Caesar, and\nHis power unto Octavia.\n\nANTONY.\nMay I \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra6\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\nDream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.\nFurther this act of grace; and from this hour\nThe heart of brothers govern in our loves\nAnd sway our great designs!\n\nCAESAR.\nThere’s my hand.\nA sister I bequeath you, whom no brother\nDid ever love so dearly. Let her live\nTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra7\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nFly off our loves again!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHappily, amen!\n\nANTONY.\nI did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,\nFor he hath laid strange courtesies and great\nOf late upon me. I must thank him only,\nLest my remembrance suffer ill report;\nAt heel of that, defy him.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTime calls upon ’s.\nOf us must Pompey presently be sought,\nOr else he seeks out us.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere lies he?\n\nCAESAR.\nAbout the Mount Misena.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat is his strength by land?\n\nCAESAR.\nGreat and increasing; but by sea\nHe is an absolute master.\n\nANTONY.\nSo is the fame.\nWould we had spoke together! Haste we for it.\nYet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\nThe business we have talked of.\n\nCAESAR.\nWith most gladness,\nAnd do invite you to my sister’s view,\nWhither straight I’ll lead you.\n\nANTONY.\nLet us, Lepidus, not lack your company.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble Antony, not sickness should detain me.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt all except Enobarbus, Agrippa and Maecenas._]\n\nMAECENAS.\nWelcome from Egypt, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHalf the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend,\nAgrippa!\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGood Enobarbus!\n\nMAECENAS.\nWe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed\nwell by ’t in Egypt.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAy, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light\nwith drinking.\n\nMAECENAS.\nEight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons\nthere. Is this true?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThis was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of\nfeast, which worthily deserved noting.\n\nMAECENAS.\nShe’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhen she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river\nof Cydnus.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThere she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI will tell you.\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,\nBurned on the water. The poop was beaten gold;\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\nThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\nIt beggared all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,\nO’erpicturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature. On each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nO, rare for Antony!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHer gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\nSo many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes,\nAnd made their bends adornings. At the helm\nA seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle\nSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands\nThat yarely frame the office. From the barge\nA strange invisible perfume hits the sense\nOf the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\nHer people out upon her, and Antony,\nEnthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone,\nWhistling to th’ air, which, but for vacancy,\nHad gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\nAnd made a gap in nature.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRare Egyptian!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUpon her landing, Antony sent to her,\nInvited her to supper. She replied\nIt should be better he became her guest,\nWhich she entreated. Our courteous Antony,\nWhom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,\nBeing barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast,\nAnd, for his ordinary, pays his heart\nFor what his eyes eat only.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRoyal wench!\nShe made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.\nHe ploughed her, and she cropped.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI saw her once\nHop forty paces through the public street\nAnd, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,\nThat she did make defect perfection,\nAnd, breathless, pour breath forth.\n\nMAECENAS.\nNow Antony must leave her utterly.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n\u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra8\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003eNever\u003c/span\u003e. He will not.\nAge cannot wither her, nor custom stale\nHer infinite variety. Other women cloy\nThe appetites they feed, but she makes hungry\nWhere most she satisfies. For vilest things\nBecome themselves in her, that the holy priests\nBless her when she is riggish.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle\nThe heart of Antony, Octavia is\nA blessed lottery to him.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nLet us go.\nGood Enobarbus, make yourself my guest\nWhilst you abide here.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHumbly, sir, I thank you.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III.

Good night, dear lady.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nGood night, sir.\n\nCAESAR.\nGood night.\n\n [_Exeunt Caesar and Octavia._]\n\n Enter Soothsayer.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nWould I had \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra9\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e come from thence, nor you thither!\n\nANTONY.\nIf you can, your reason.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nI see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue.\nBut yet hie you to Egypt again.\n\nANTONY.\nSay to me,\nWhose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nCaesar’s.\nTherefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.\nThy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is\nNoble, courageous, high, unmatchable,\nWhere Caesar’s is not. But near him, thy angel\nBecomes afeard, as being o’erpowered. Therefore\nMake space enough between you.\n\nANTONY.\nSpeak this no more.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nTo none but thee; no more but when to thee.\nIf thou dost play with him at any game,\nThou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck\nHe beats thee ’gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens\nWhen he shines by. I say again, thy spirit\nIs all afraid to govern thee near him;\nBut, he away, ’tis noble.\n\nANTONY.\nGet thee gone.\nSay to Ventidius I would speak with him.\n\n [_Exit Soothsayer._]\n\nHe shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,\nHe hath spoken true. The very dice obey him,\nAnd in our sports my better cunning faints\nUnder his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;\nHis cocks do win the battle still of mine\nWhen it is all to naught, and his quails ever\nBeat mine, inhooped, at odds. I will to Egypt:\nAnd though I make this marriage for my peace,\nI’ th’ East my pleasure lies.\n\n Enter Ventidius.\n\nO, come, Ventidius,\nYou must to Parthia. Your commission’s ready.\nFollow me and receive ’t.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Rome. A street.\n\n Enter Lepidus, Maecenas and Agrippa.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTrouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten\nYour generals after.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nSir, Mark Antony\nWill e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTill I shall see you in your soldier’s dress,\nWhich will become you both, farewell.\n\nMAECENAS.\nWe shall,\nAs I conceive the journey, be at the Mount\nBefore you, Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour way is shorter;\nMy purposes do draw me much about.\nYou’ll win two days upon me.\n\nBOTH.\nSir, good success!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nFarewell.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V.

Let’s to billiards. Come, Charmian.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMy arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAs well a woman with an eunuch played\nAs with a woman. Come, you’ll play with me, sir?\n\nMARDIAN.\nAs well as I can, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd when good will is showed, though’t come too short,\nThe actor may plead pardon. I’ll none now.\nGive me mine angle; we’ll to the river. There,\nMy music playing far off, I will betray\nTawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce\nTheir slimy jaws, and as I draw them up\nI’ll think them every one an Antony,\nAnd say “Ah, ha! You’re caught.”\n\nCHARMIAN.\n’Twas merry when\nYou wagered on your angling; when your diver\nDid hang a salt fish on his hook, which he\nWith fervency drew up.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat time?—O times!—\nI laughed him out of patience; and that night\nI laughed him into patience, and next morn,\nEre the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,\nThen put my tires and mantles on him, whilst\nI wore his sword Philippan.\n\n Enter Messenger.\n\nO! from Italy!\nRam thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,\nThat long time have been barren.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, madam—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAntony’s dead! If thou say so, villain,\nThou kill’st thy mistress. But well and free,\nIf thou so yield him, there is gold, and here\nMy bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings\nHave lipped, and trembled kissing.\n\nMESSENGER.\nFirst, madam, he’s well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy, there’s more gold.\nBut sirrah, mark, we use\nTo say the dead are well. Bring it to that,\nThe gold I give thee will I melt and pour\nDown thy ill-uttering throat.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGood madam, hear me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell, go to, I will.\nBut there’s no goodness in thy face if Antony\nBe free and healthful. So tart a favour\nTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well,\nThou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes,\nNot like a formal man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nWill’t please you hear me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.\nYet if thou say Antony lives, is well,\nOr friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\nI’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail\nRich pearls upon thee.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he’s well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell said.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAnd friends with Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nTh’ art an honest man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nCaesar and he are greater friends than ever.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMake thee a fortune from me.\n\nMESSENGER.\nBut yet, madam—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI do not like “But yet”, it does allay\nThe good precedence. Fie upon “But yet”!\n“But yet” is as a gaoler to bring forth\nSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\nPour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\nThe good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar,\nIn state of health, thou say’st; and, thou say’st, free.\n\nMESSENGER.\nFree, madam? No. I made no such report.\nHe’s bound unto Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFor what good turn?\n\nMESSENGER.\nFor the best turn i’ th’ bed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am pale, Charmian.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he’s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe most infectious pestilence upon thee!\n\n [_Strikes him down._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nGood madam, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat say you?\n\n [_Strikes him again._]\n\nHence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes\nLike balls before me! I’ll unhair thy head!\n\n [_She hales him up and down._]\n\nThou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine,\nSmarting in ling’ring pickle.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGracious madam,\nI that do bring the news made not the match.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSay ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,\nAnd make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst\nShall make thy peace for moving me to rage,\nAnd I will boot thee with what gift beside\nThy modesty can beg.\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe’s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nRogue, thou hast lived too long.\n\n [_Draws a knife._]\n\nMESSENGER.\nNay then I’ll run.\nWhat mean you, madam? I have made no fault.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood madam, keep yourself within yourself.\nThe man is innocent.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSome innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.\nMelt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures\nTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again.\nThough I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHe is afeard to come.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI will not hurt him.\n\n [_Exit Charmian._]\n\nThese hands do lack nobility that they strike\nA meaner than myself, since I myself\nHave given myself the cause.\n\n Enter the Messenger again with Charmian.\n\nCome hither, sir.\nThough it be honest, it is \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra10\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e good\nTo bring bad news. Give to a gracious message\nAn host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell\nThemselves when they be felt.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI have done my duty.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs he married?\nI cannot hate thee worser than I do\nIf thou again say “Yes.”\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe’s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still!\n\nMESSENGER.\nShould I lie, madam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, I would thou didst,\nSo half my Egypt were submerged and made\nA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence.\nHadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\nThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nI crave your highness’ pardon.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nTake no offence that I would not offend you.\nTo punish me for what you make me do\nSeems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, that his fault should make a knave of thee\nThat art not what thou’rt sure of! Get thee hence!\nThe merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\nAre all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,\nAnd be undone by ’em!\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood your highness, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIn praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMany times, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am paid for’t now.\nLead me from hence;\nI faint. O Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter.\nGo to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him\nReport the feature of Octavia, her years,\nHer inclination; let him not leave out\nThe colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.\n\n [_Exit Alexas._]\n\nLet him for ever go—let him not, Charmian.\nThough he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\nThe other way ’s a Mars. [_To Mardian_] Bid you Alexas\nBring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,\nBut do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Near Misenum.\n\n Flourish. Enter Pompey and Menas at one door, with drum and trumpet;\n at another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa,\n with Soldiers marching.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYour hostages I have, so have you mine,\nAnd we shall talk before we fight.\n\nCAESAR.\nMost meet\nThat first we come to words, and therefore have we\nOur written purposes before us sent,\nWhich if thou hast considered, let us know\nIf ’twill tie up thy discontented sword\nAnd carry back to Sicily much tall youth\nThat else must perish here.\n\nPOMPEY.\nTo you all three,\nThe senators alone of this great world,\nChief factors for the gods: I do not know\nWherefore my father should revengers want,\nHaving a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,\nWho at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\nThere saw you labouring for him. What was’t\nThat moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what\nMade the all-honoured, honest Roman, Brutus,\nWith the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,\nTo drench the Capitol, but that they would\nHave one man but a man? And that is it\nHath made me rig my navy, at whose burden\nThe angered ocean foams, with which I meant\nTo scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome\nCast on my noble father.\n\nCAESAR.\nTake your time.\n\nANTONY.\nThou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.\nWe’ll speak with thee at sea. At land thou know’st\nHow much we do o’ercount thee.\n\nPOMPEY.\nAt land indeed\nThou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house;\nBut since the cuckoo builds not for himself,\nRemain in’t as thou mayst.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nBe pleased to tell us—\nFor this is from the present—how you take\nThe offers we have sent you.\n\nCAESAR.\nThere’s the point.\n\nANTONY.\nWhich do not be entreated to, but weigh\nWhat it is worth embraced.\n\nCAESAR.\nAnd what may follow\nTo try a larger fortune.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYou have made me offer\nOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I must\nRid all the sea of pirates; then to send\nMeasures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon,\nTo part with unhacked edges and bear back\nOur targes undinted.\n\nCAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.\nThat’s our offer.\n\nPOMPEY.\nKnow, then,\nI came before you here a man prepared\nTo take this offer. But Mark Antony\nPut me to some impatience. Though I lose\nThe praise of it by telling, you must know\nWhen Caesar and your brother were at blows,\nYour mother came to Sicily and did find\nHer welcome friendly.\n\nANTONY.\nI have heard it, Pompey,\nAnd am well studied for a liberal thanks\nWhich I do owe you.\n\nPOMPEY.\nLet me have your hand.\nI did not think, sir, to have met you here.\n\nANTONY.\nThe beds i’ th’ East are soft; and thanks to you,\nThat called me timelier than my purpose hither,\nFor I have gained by ’t.\n\nCAESAR.\nSince I saw you last,\nThere is a change upon you.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWell, I know not\nWhat counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,\nBut in my bosom shall she \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra11\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e come\nTo make my heart her vassal.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWell met here.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.\nI crave our composition may be written\nAnd sealed between us.\n\nCAESAR.\nThat’s the next to do.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWe’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s\nDraw lots who shall begin.\n\nANTONY.\nThat will I, Pompey.\n\nPOMPEY.\nNo, Antony, take the lot.\nBut, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery\nShall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar\nGrew fat with feasting there.\n\nANTONY.\nYou have heard much.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI have fair meanings, sir.\n\nANTONY.\nAnd fair words to them.\n\nPOMPEY.\nThen so much have I heard.\nAnd I have heard Apollodorus carried—\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo more of that. He did so.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhat, I pray you?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nA certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI know thee now. How far’st thou, soldier?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWell;\nAnd well am like to do, for I perceive\nFour feasts are toward.\n\nPOMPEY.\nLet me shake thy hand.\nI \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra12\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e hated thee. I have seen thee fight\nWhen I have envied thy behaviour.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSir,\nI \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra13\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye\nWhen you have well deserved ten times as much\nAs I have said you did.\n\nPOMPEY.\nEnjoy thy plainness;\nIt nothing ill becomes thee.\nAboard my galley I invite you all.\nWill you lead, lords?\n\nCAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.\nShow’s the way, sir.\n\nPOMPEY.\nCome.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Enobarbus and Menas._]\n\nMENAS.\n[_Aside_.] Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.—\nYou and I have known, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAt sea, I think.\n\nMENAS.\nWe have, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYou have done well by water.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd you by land.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied\nwhat I have done by land.\n\nMENAS.\nNor what I have done by water.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great\nthief by sea.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd you by land.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThere I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas. If our eyes\nhad authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.\n\nMENAS.\nAll men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut there is \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra14\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e a fair woman has a true face.\n\nMENAS.\nNo slander. They steal hearts.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWe came hither to fight with you.\n\nMENAS.\nFor my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this\nday laugh away his fortune.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nIf he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.\n\nMENAS.\nYou have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he\nmarried to Cleopatra?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nCaesar’s sister is called Octavia.\n\nMENAS.\nTrue, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.\n\nMENAS.\nPray you, sir?\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’Tis true.\n\nMENAS.\nThen is Caesar and he for ever knit together.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nIf I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.\n\nMENAS.\nI think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the\nlove of the parties.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their\nfriendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia\nis of a holy, cold, and still conversation.\n\nMENAS.\nWho would not have his wife so?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his\nEgyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up\nin Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their\namity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will\nuse his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for\nyou.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt.\n\nMENAS.\nCome, let’s away.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. On board Pompey’s Galley, lying near Misenum.\n\n Music.

Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already; the\nleast wind i’ th’ world will blow them down.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nLepidus is high-coloured.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nThey have made him drink alms-drink.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nAs they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out “no more”,\nreconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nBut it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWhy, this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship. I had as lief\nhave a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nTo be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in ’t, are\nthe holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.\n\n A sennet sounded. Enter Caesar, Antony, Pompey, Lepidus, Agrippa,\n Maecenas, Enobarbus, Menas with other Captains.\n\nANTONY.\n[_To Caesar_.] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile\nBy certain scales i’ th’ pyramid; they know\nBy th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\nOr foison follow. The higher Nilus swells,\nThe more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman\nUpon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\nAnd shortly comes to harvest.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYou’ve strange serpents there?\n\nANTONY.\nAy, Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your\nsun; so is your crocodile.\n\nANTONY.\nThey are so.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSit, and some wine! A health to Lepidus!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nI am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot till you have slept. I fear me you’ll be in till then.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly\nthings. Without contradiction I have heard that.\n\nMENAS.\n[_Aside to Pompey_.] Pompey, a word.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[_Aside to Menas_.] Say in mine ear what is ’t?\n\nMENAS.\n[_Whispers in ’s ear._] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,\nAnd hear me speak a word.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[_Aside to Menas._] Forbear me till anon.—\nThis wine for Lepidus!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWhat manner o’ thing is your crocodile?\n\nANTONY.\nIt is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.\nIt is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs. It lives by\nthat which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it\ntransmigrates.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWhat colour is it of?\n\nANTONY.\nOf its own colour too.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis a strange serpent.\n\nANTONY.\n’Tis so, and the tears of it are wet.\n\nCAESAR.\nWill this description satisfy him?\n\nANTONY.\nWith the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[_Aside to Menas._] Go hang, sir, hang!

Let me cut the cable,\nAnd when we are put off, fall to their throats.\nAll then is thine.\n\nPOMPEY.\nAh, this thou shouldst have done\nAnd not have spoke on ’t! In me ’tis villainy;\nIn thee ’t had been good service. Thou must know\n’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;\nMine honour it. Repent that e’er thy tongue\nHath so betray’d thine act.

Strong Enobarb\nIs weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue\nSplits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost\nAnticked us all. What needs more words. Good night.\nGood Antony, your hand.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI’ll try you on the shore.\n\nANTONY.\nAnd shall, sir. Give’s your hand.\n\nPOMPEY.\nO Antony,\nYou have my father’s house.\nBut, what? We are friends. Come, down into the boat.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nTake heed you fall not.\n\n [_Exeunt Pompey, Caesar, Antony and Attendants._]\n\nMenas, I’ll not on shore.\n\nMENAS.\nNo, to my cabin. These drums, these trumpets, flutes! What!\nLet Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell\nTo these great fellows. Sound and be hanged, sound out!\n\n [_Sound a flourish with drums._]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHoo, says ’a! There’s my cap!\n\nMENAS.\nHoo! Noble captain, come.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nSCENE I. A plain in Syria.\n\n Enter Ventidius as it were in triumph, with Silius and other Romans,\n Officers and Soldiers; the dead body of Pacorus borne before him.\n\nVENTIDIUS.\nNow, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now\nPleased Fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death\nMake me revenger. Bear the king’s son’s body\nBefore our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,\nPays this for Marcus Crassus.\n\nSILIUS.\nNoble Ventidius,\nWhilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,\nThe fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,\nMesopotamia, and the shelters whither\nThe routed fly. So thy grand captain Antony\nShall set thee on triumphant chariots, and\nPut garlands on thy head.\n\nVENTIDIUS.\nO Silius, Silius,\nI have done enough. A lower place, note well,\nMay make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:\nBetter to leave undone than by our deed\nAcquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away.\nCaesar and Antony have ever won\nMore in their officer, than person. Sossius,\nOne of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,\nFor quick accumulation of renown,\nWhich he achieved by th’ minute, lost his favour.\nWho does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can\nBecomes his captain’s captain; and ambition,\nThe soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss\nThan gain which darkens him.\nI could do more to do Antonius good,\nBut ’twould offend him, and in his offence\nShould my performance perish.\n\nSILIUS.\nThou hast, Ventidius, that\nWithout the which a soldier and his sword\nGrants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?\n\nVENTIDIUS.\nI’ll humbly signify what in his name,\nThat magical word of war, we have effected;\nHow, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,\nThe ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia\nWe have jaded out o’ th’ field.\n\nSILIUS.\nWhere is he now?\n\nVENTIDIUS.\nHe purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste\nThe weight we must convey with ’s will permit,\nWe shall appear before him.—On there, pass along!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Rome. An Ante-chamber in Caesar’s house.\n\n Enter Agrippa at one door, Enobarbus at another.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWhat, are the brothers parted?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThey have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.\nThe other three are sealing. Octavia weeps\nTo part from Rome. Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,\nSince Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled\nWith the greensickness.\n\nAGRIPPA.\n’Tis a noble Lepidus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nA very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!\n\nAGRIPPA.\nNay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nCaesar? Why he’s the Jupiter of men.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWhat’s Antony? The god of Jupiter.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSpake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil!\n\nAGRIPPA.\nO, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWould you praise Caesar, say “Caesar”. Go no further.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nIndeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony.\nHoo! Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot\nThink, speak, cast, write, sing, number—hoo!—\nHis love to Antony. But as for Caesar,\nKneel down, kneel down, and wonder.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nBoth he loves.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThey are his shards, and he their beetle.\n\n [_Trumpets within._]\n\nSo,\nThis is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGood fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.\n\n Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus and Octavia.\n\nANTONY.\nNo further, sir.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou take from me a great part of myself.\nUse me well in’t. Sister, prove such a wife\nAs my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bond\nShall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,\nLet not the piece of virtue which is set\nBetwixt us, as the cement of our love\nTo keep it builded, be the ram to batter\nThe fortress of it. For better might we\nHave loved without this mean, if on both parts\nThis be not cherished.\n\nANTONY.\nMake me not offended\nIn your distrust.\n\nCAESAR.\nI have said.\n\nANTONY.\nYou shall not find,\nThough you be therein curious, the least cause\nFor what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,\nAnd make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.\nWe will here part.\n\nCAESAR.\nFarewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.\nThe elements be kind to thee, and make\nThy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nMy noble brother!\n\nANTONY.\nThe April’s in her eyes. It is love’s spring,\nAnd these the showers to bring it on.—Be cheerful.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nSir, look well to my husband’s house, and—\n\nCAESAR.\nWhat, Octavia?\n\nOCTAVIA.\nI’ll tell you in your ear.\n\nANTONY.\nHer tongue will not obey her heart, nor can\nHer heart inform her tongue—the swan’s-down feather,\nThat stands upon the swell at the full of tide,\nAnd neither way inclines.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside to Agrippa_.] Will Caesar weep?\n\nAGRIPPA.\n[_Aside to Enobarbus_.] He has a cloud in ’s face.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside to Agrippa_.] He were the worse for that were he a horse;\nSo is he, being a man.\n\nAGRIPPA.\n[_Aside to Enobarbus_.] Why, Enobarbus,\nWhen Antony found Julius Caesar dead,\nHe cried almost to roaring, and he wept\nWhen at Philippi he found Brutus slain.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside to Agrippa_.] That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum;\nWhat willingly he did confound he wailed,\nBelieve ’t, till I weep too.\n\nCAESAR.\nNo, sweet Octavia,\nYou shall hear from me still. The time shall not\nOutgo my thinking on you.\n\nANTONY.\nCome, sir, come,\nI’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love.\nLook, here I have you, thus I let you go,\nAnd give you to the gods.\n\nCAESAR.\nAdieu, be happy!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nLet all the number of the stars give light\nTo thy fair way!\n\nCAESAR.\nFarewell, farewell!\n\n [_Kisses Octavia._]\n\nANTONY.\nFarewell!\n\n [_Trumpets sound. Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and Alexas.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere is the fellow?\n\nALEXAS.\nHalf afeared to come.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGo to, go to.\n\n Enter a Messenger as before.\n\nCome hither, sir.\n\nALEXAS.\nGood majesty,\nHerod of Jewry dare not look upon you\nBut when you are well pleased.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat Herod’s head\nI’ll have! But how, when Antony is gone,\nThrough whom I might command it?—Come thou near.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMost gracious majesty!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDidst thou behold Octavia?\n\nMESSENGER.\nAy, dread queen.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere?\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, in Rome\nI looked her in the face, and saw her led\nBetween her brother and Mark Antony.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs she as tall as me?\n\nMESSENGER.\nShe is not, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDidst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat’s not so good. He cannot like her long.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nLike her? O Isis! ’Tis impossible.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI think so, Charmian: dull of tongue and dwarfish!\nWhat majesty is in her gait? Remember,\nIf e’er thou look’dst on majesty.\n\nMESSENGER.\nShe creeps.\nHer motion and her station are as one.\nShe shows a body rather than a life,\nA statue than a breather.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs this certain?\n\nMESSENGER.\nOr I have no observance.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nThree in Egypt\nCannot make better note.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe’s very knowing;\nI do perceive’t. There’s nothing in her yet.\nThe fellow has good judgment.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nExcellent.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGuess at her years, I prithee.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam,\nShe was a widow.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWidow! Charmian, hark!\n\nMESSENGER.\nAnd I do think she’s thirty.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long or round?\n\nMESSENGER.\nRound even to faultiness.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFor the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.\nHer hair, what colour?\n\nMESSENGER.\nBrown, madam, and her forehead\nAs low as she would wish it.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThere’s gold for thee.\nThou must not take my former sharpness ill.\nI will employ thee back again; I find thee\nMost fit for business. Go make thee ready;\nOur letters are prepared.\n\n [_Exit Messenger._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nA proper man.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIndeed, he is so. I repent me much\nThat so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,\nThis creature’s no such thing.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNothing, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe man hath seen some majesty, and should know.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,\nAnd serving you so long!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.\nBut ’tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me\nWhere I will write. All may be well enough.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nI warrant you, madam.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. Athens. A Room in Antony’s House.\n\n Enter Antony and Octavia.\n\nANTONY.\nNay, nay, Octavia, not only that—\nThat were excusable, that and thousands more\nOf semblable import—but he hath waged\nNew wars ’gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it\nTo public ear;\nSpoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not\nBut pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly\nHe vented them; most narrow measure lent me;\nWhen the best hint was given him, he not took ’t,\nOr did it from his teeth.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nO, my good lord,\nBelieve not all, or if you must believe,\nStomach not all. A more unhappy lady,\nIf this division chance, ne’er stood between,\nPraying for both parts.\nThe good gods will mock me presently\nWhen I shall pray “O, bless my lord and husband!”\nUndo that prayer by crying out as loud\n“O, bless my brother!” Husband win, win brother,\nPrays and destroys the prayer; no midway\n’Twixt these extremes at all.\n\nANTONY.\nGentle Octavia,\nLet your best love draw to that point which seeks\nBest to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,\nI lose myself; better I were not yours\nThan yours so branchless. But, as you requested,\nYourself shall go between’s. The meantime, lady,\nI’ll raise the preparation of a war\nShall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste,\nSo your desires are yours.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nThanks to my lord.\nThe Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,\nYour reconciler! Wars ’twixt you twain would be\nAs if the world should cleave, and that slain men\nShould solder up the rift.\n\nANTONY.\nWhen it appears to you where this begins,\nTurn your displeasure that way, for our faults\nCan \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra17\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e be so equal that your love\nCan equally move with them. Provide your going;\nChoose your own company, and command what cost\nYour heart has mind to.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Athens. Another Room in Antony’s House.\n\n Enter Enobarbus and Eros meeting.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHow now, friend Eros?\n\nEROS.\nThere’s strange news come, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat, man?\n\nEROS.\nCaesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThis is old. What is the success?\n\nEROS.\nCaesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently\ndenied him rivality; would not let him partake in the glory of the\naction, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly\nwrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him. So the poor third is\nup, till death enlarge his confine.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThen, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more,\nAnd throw between them all the food thou hast,\nThey’ll grind the one the other. Where’s Antony?\n\nEROS.\nHe’s walking in the garden, thus, and spurns\nThe rush that lies before him; cries “Fool Lepidus!”\nAnd threats the throat of that his officer\nThat murdered Pompey.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nOur great navy’s rigged.\n\nEROS.\nFor Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:\nMy lord desires you presently. My news\nI might have told hereafter.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’Twill be naught,\nBut let it be. Bring me to Antony.\n\nEROS.\nCome, sir.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Rome. A Room in Caesar’s House.\n\n Enter Agrippa, Maecenas and Caesar.\n\nCAESAR.\nContemning Rome, he has done all this, and more\nIn Alexandria. Here’s the manner of ’t:\nI’ th’ market-place, on a tribunal silvered,\nCleopatra and himself in chairs of gold\nWere publicly enthroned. At the feet sat\nCaesarion, whom they call my father’s son,\nAnd all the unlawful issue that their lust\nSince then hath made between them. Unto her\nHe gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her\nOf lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,\nAbsolute queen.\n\nMAECENAS.\nThis in the public eye?\n\nCAESAR.\nI’ th’ common showplace where they exercise.\nHis sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings:\nGreat Media, Parthia, and Armenia\nHe gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned\nSyria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She\nIn th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis\nThat day appeared, and oft before gave audience,\nAs ’tis reported, so.\n\nMAECENAS.\nLet Rome be thus informed.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWho, queasy with his insolence already,\nWill their good thoughts call from him.\n\nCAESAR.\nThe people knows it and have now received\nHis accusations.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWho does he accuse?\n\nCAESAR.\nCaesar, and that, having in Sicily\nSextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him\nHis part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me\nSome shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets\nThat Lepidus of the triumvirate\nShould be deposed and, being, that we detain\nAll his revenue.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nSir, this should be answered.\n\nCAESAR.\n’Tis done already, and messenger gone.\nI have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,\nThat he his high authority abused,\nAnd did deserve his change. For what I have conquered\nI grant him part; but then in his Armenia\nAnd other of his conquered kingdoms, I\nDemand the like.\n\nMAECENAS.\nHe’ll \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra18\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e yield to that.\n\nCAESAR.\nNor must not then be yielded to in this.\n\n Enter Octavia with her train.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nHail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar!\n\nCAESAR.\nThat ever I should call thee castaway!\n\nOCTAVIA.\nYou have not called me so, nor have you cause.\n\nCAESAR.\nWhy have you stolen upon us thus? You come not\nLike Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony\nShould have an army for an usher, and\nThe neighs of horse to tell of her approach\nLong ere she did appear. The trees by th’ way\nShould have borne men, and expectation fainted,\nLonging for what it had not. Nay, the dust\nShould have ascended to the roof of heaven,\nRaised by your populous troops. But you are come\nA market-maid to Rome, and have prevented\nThe ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,\nIs often left unloved. We should have met you\nBy sea and land, supplying every stage\nWith an augmented greeting.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nGood my lord,\nTo come thus was I not constrained, but did it\nOn my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,\nHearing that you prepared for war, acquainted\nMy grieved ear withal, whereon I begged\nHis pardon for return.\n\nCAESAR.\nWhich soon he granted,\nBeing an abstract ’tween his lust and him.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nDo not say so, my lord.\n\nCAESAR.\nI have eyes upon him,\nAnd his affairs come to me on the wind.\nWhere is he now?\n\nOCTAVIA.\nMy lord, in Athens.\n\nCAESAR.\nNo, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra\nHath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire\nUp to a whore, who now are levying\nThe kings o’ th’ earth for war. He hath assembled\nBocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus\nOf Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king\nOf Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;\nKing Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;\nHerod of Jewry; Mithridates, king\nOf Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,\nThe kings of Mede and Lycaonia,\nWith a more larger list of sceptres.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nAy me, most wretched,\nThat have my heart parted betwixt two friends\nThat does afflict each other!\n\nCAESAR.\nWelcome hither.\nYour letters did withhold our breaking forth\nTill we perceived both how you were wrong led\nAnd we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart.\nBe you not troubled with the time, which drives\nO’er your content these strong necessities,\nBut let determined things to destiny\nHold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome,\nNothing more dear to me. You are abused\nBeyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,\nTo do you justice, make their ministers\nOf us and those that love you. Best of comfort,\nAnd ever welcome to us.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWelcome, lady.\n\nMAECENAS.\nWelcome, dear madam.\nEach heart in Rome does love and pity you.\nOnly th’ adulterous Antony, most large\nIn his abominations, turns you off\nAnd gives his potent regiment to a trull\nThat noises it against us.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nIs it so, sir?\n\nCAESAR.\nMost certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you\nBe ever known to patience. My dear’st sister!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VII. Antony’s Camp near the Promontory of Actium.\n\n Enter Cleopatra and Enobarbus.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI will be even with thee, doubt it not.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut why, why, why?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThou hast forspoke my being in these wars\nAnd say’st it is not fit.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWell, is it, is it?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs ’t not denounced against us? Why should not we\nBe there in person?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWell, I could reply:\nIf we should serve with horse and mares together,\nThe horse were merely lost. The mares would bear\nA soldier and his horse.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat is’t you say?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYour presence needs must puzzle Antony,\nTake from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s time,\nWhat should not then be spared. He is already\nTraduced for levity, and ’tis said in Rome\nThat Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids\nManage this war.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSink Rome, and their tongues rot\nThat speak against us! A charge we bear i’ th’ war,\nAnd, as the president of my kingdom, will\nAppear there for a man. Speak not against it.\nI will not stay behind.\n\n Enter Antony and Canidius.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNay, I have done.\nHere comes the Emperor.\n\nANTONY.\nIs it not strange, Canidius,\nThat from Tarentum and Brundusium\nHe could so quickly cut the Ionian sea\nAnd take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCelerity is \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra19\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e more admired\nThan by the negligent.\n\nANTONY.\nA good rebuke,\nWhich might have well becomed the best of men\nTo taunt at slackness.—Canidius, we\nWill fight with him by sea.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBy sea, what else?\n\nCANIDIUS.\nWhy will my lord do so?\n\nANTONY.\nFor that he dares us to ’t.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSo hath my lord dared him to single fight.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nAy, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,\nWhere Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,\nWhich serve not for his vantage, he shakes off,\nAnd so should you.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYour ships are not well manned,\nYour mariners are muleteers, reapers, people\nEngrossed by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleet\nAre those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.\nTheir ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace\nShall fall you for refusing him at sea,\nBeing prepared for land.\n\nANTONY.\nBy sea, by sea.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nMost worthy sir, you therein throw away\nThe absolute soldiership you have by land;\nDistract your army, which doth most consist\nOf war-marked footmen; leave unexecuted\nYour own renowned knowledge; quite forgo\nThe way which promises assurance; and\nGive up yourself merely to chance and hazard\nFrom firm security.\n\nANTONY.\nI’ll fight at sea.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI have sixty sails, Caesar none better.\n\nANTONY.\nOur overplus of shipping will we burn,\nAnd with the rest full-manned, from th’ head of Actium\nBeat th’ approaching Caesar. But if we fail,\nWe then can do ’t at land.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nThy business?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe news is true, my lord; he is descried.\nCaesar has taken Toryne.\n\nANTONY.\nCan he be there in person? ’Tis impossible;\nStrange that his power should be. Canidius,\nOur nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,\nAnd our twelve thousand horse. We’ll to our ship.\nAway, my Thetis!\n\n Enter a Soldier.\n\nHow now, worthy soldier?\n\nSOLDIER.\nO noble emperor, do not fight by sea.\nTrust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt\nThis sword and these my wounds? Let th’ Egyptians\nAnd the Phoenicians go a-ducking. We\nHave used to conquer standing on the earth\nAnd fighting foot to foot.\n\nANTONY.\nWell, well, away.\n\n [_Exeunt Antony, Cleopatra and Enobarbus._]\n\nSOLDIER.\nBy Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nSoldier, thou art. But his whole action grows\nNot in the power on ’t. So our leader’s led,\nAnd we are women’s men.\n\nSOLDIER.\nYou keep by land\nThe legions and the horse whole, do you not?\n\nCANIDIUS.\nMarcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,\nPublicola, and Caelius are for sea,\nBut we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar’s\nCarries beyond belief.\n\nSOLDIER.\nWhile he was yet in Rome,\nHis power went out in such distractions as\nBeguiled all spies.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nWho’s his lieutenant, hear you?\n\nSOLDIER.\nThey say one Taurus.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nWell I know the man.\n\n Enter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe Emperor calls Canidius.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nWith news the time’s with labour, and throes forth\nEach minute some.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.\n\n Enter Caesar with his army and Taurus marching.\n\nCAESAR.\nTaurus!\n\nTAURUS.\nMy lord?\n\nCAESAR.\nStrike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle\nTill we have done at sea. Do not exceed\nThe prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies\nUpon this jump.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IX. Another part of the Plain.\n\n Enter Antony and Enobarbus.\n\nANTONY.\nSet we our squadrons on yon side o’ th’ hill\nIn eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place\nWe may the number of the ships behold\nAnd so proceed accordingly.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE X. Another part of the Plain.\n\nCanidius marching with his land army one way over the stage, and\nTaurus, the Lieutenant of Caesar, with his Army, the other way. After\ntheir going in, is heard the noise of a sea fight.\n\n Alarum. Enter Enobarbus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNaught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.\nTh’ Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,\nWith all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.\nTo see ’t mine eyes are blasted.\n\n Enter Scarus.\n\nSCARUS.\nGods and goddesses,\nAll the whole synod of them!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat’s thy passion?\n\nSCARUS.\nThe greater cantle of the world is lost\nWith very ignorance. We have kissed away\nKingdoms and provinces.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHow appears the fight?\n\nSCARUS.\nOn our side like, the tokened pestilence,\nWhere death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,\nWhom leprosy o’ertake, i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight,\nWhen vantage like a pair of twins appeared,\nBoth as the same—or, rather, ours the elder—\nThe breeze upon her, like a cow in June,\nHoists sails and flies.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThat I beheld.\nMine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not\nEndure a further view.\n\nSCARUS.\nShe once being loofed,\nThe noble ruin of her magic, Antony,\nClaps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard,\nLeaving the fight in height, flies after her.\nI \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra20\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e saw an action of such shame.\nExperience, manhood, honour, ne’er before\nDid violate so itself.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAlack, alack!\n\n Enter Canidius.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nOur fortune on the sea is out of breath\nAnd sinks most lamentably. Had our general\nBeen what he knew himself, it had gone well.\nO, he has given example for our flight\nMost grossly by his own!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAy, are you thereabouts?\nWhy, then, good night indeed.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nToward Peloponnesus are they fled.\n\nSCARUS.\n’Tis easy to’t, and there I will attend\nWhat further comes.\n\nCANIDIUS.\nTo Caesar will I render\nMy legions and my horse. Six kings already\nShow me the way of yielding.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI’ll yet follow\nThe wounded chance of Antony, though my reason\nSits in the wind against me.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XI. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Antony with attendants.\n\nANTONY.\nHark, the land bids me tread no more upon’t.\nIt is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.\nI am so lated in the world that I\nHave lost my way for ever. I have a ship\nLaden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly,\nAnd make your peace with Caesar.\n\nALL.\nFly? Not we.\n\nANTONY.\nI have fled myself, and have instructed cowards\nTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone.\nI have myself resolved upon a course\nWhich has no need of you. Be gone.\nMy treasure’s in the harbour. Take it. O,\nI followed that I blush to look upon.\nMy very hairs do mutiny, for the white\nReprove the brown for rashness, and they them\nFor fear and doting. Friends, be gone. You shall\nHave letters from me to some friends that will\nSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,\nNor make replies of loathness. Take the hint\nWhich my despair proclaims. Let that be left\nWhich leaves itself. To the sea-side straightway.\nI will possess you of that ship and treasure.\nLeave me, I pray, a little—pray you, now,\nNay, do so; for indeed I have lost command.\nTherefore I pray you. I’ll see you by and by.\n\n [_Sits down._]\n\n Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian, Iras and Eros.\n\nEROS.\nNay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.\n\nIRAS.\nDo, most dear queen.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nDo! Why, what else?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nLet me sit down. O Juno!\n\nANTONY.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nEROS.\nSee you here, sir?\n\nANTONY.\nO, fie, fie, fie!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam.\n\nIRAS.\nMadam, O good empress!\n\nEROS.\nSir, sir!\n\nANTONY.\nYes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept\nHis sword e’en like a dancer, while I struck\nThe lean and wrinkled Cassius, and ’twas I\nThat the mad Brutus ended. He alone\nDealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had\nIn the brave squares of war. Yet now—no matter.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAh, stand by.\n\nEROS.\nThe Queen, my lord, the Queen!\n\nIRAS.\nGo to him, madam; speak to him.\nHe is unqualitied with very shame.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell then, sustain me. O!\n\nEROS.\nMost noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches.\nHer head’s declined, and death will seize her but\nYour comfort makes the rescue.\n\nANTONY.\nI have offended reputation,\nA most unnoble swerving.\n\nEROS.\nSir, the Queen.\n\nANTONY.\nO, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See\nHow I convey my shame out of thine eyes\nBy looking back what I have left behind\n’Stroyed in dishonour.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO my lord, my lord,\nForgive my fearful sails! I little thought\nYou would have followed.\n\nANTONY.\nEgypt, thou knew’st too well\nMy heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings,\nAnd thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit\nThy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that\nThy beck might from the bidding of the gods\nCommand me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, my pardon!\n\nANTONY.\nNow I must\nTo the young man send humble treaties, dodge\nAnd palter in the shifts of lowness, who\nWith half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased,\nMaking and marring fortunes. You did know\nHow much you were my conqueror, and that\nMy sword, made weak by my affection, would\nObey it on all cause.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPardon, pardon!\n\nANTONY.\nFall not a tear, I say; one of them rates\nAll that is won and lost. Give me a kiss.\nEven this repays me.\nWe sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back?\nLove, I am full of lead. Some wine\nWithin there, and our viands! Fortune knows\nWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XII. Caesar’s camp in Egypt.\n\n Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Dolabella with others.\n\nCAESAR.\nLet him appear that’s come from Antony.\nKnow you him?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCaesar, ’tis his schoolmaster—\nAn argument that he is plucked, when hither\nHe sends so poor a pinion of his wing,\nWhich had superfluous kings for messengers\nNot many moons gone by.\n\n Enter Ambassador from Anthony.\n\nCAESAR.\nApproach, and speak.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nSuch as I am, I come from Antony.\nI was of late as petty to his ends\nAs is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf\nTo his grand sea.\n\nCAESAR.\nBe’t so. Declare thine office.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nLord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and\nRequires to live in Egypt, which not granted,\nHe lessens his requests, and to thee sues\nTo let him breathe between the heavens and earth,\nA private man in Athens. This for him.\nNext, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,\nSubmits her to thy might, and of thee craves\nThe circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,\nNow hazarded to thy grace.\n\nCAESAR.\nFor Antony,\nI have no ears to his request. The queen\nOf audience nor desire shall fail, so she\nFrom Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,\nOr take his life there. This if she perform,\nShe shall not sue unheard. So to them both.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nFortune pursue thee!\n\nCAESAR.\nBring him through the bands.\n\n [_Exit Ambassador, attended._]\n\n[_To Thidias_.] To try thy eloquence now ’tis time. Dispatch.\nFrom Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,\nAnd in our name, what she requires; add more,\nFrom thine invention, offers. Women are not\nIn their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure\nThe ne’er-touch’d vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias;\nMake thine own edict for thy pains, which we\nWill answer as a law.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nCaesar, I go.\n\nCAESAR.\nObserve how Antony becomes his flaw,\nAnd what thou think’st his very action speaks\nIn every power that moves.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nCaesar, I shall.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XIII. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat shall we do, Enobarbus?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThink, and die.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs Antony or we in fault for this?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAntony only, that would make his will\nLord of his reason. What though you fled\nFrom that great face of war, whose several ranges\nFrighted each other? Why should he follow?\nThe itch of his affection should not then\nHave nicked his captainship, at such a point,\nWhen half to half the world opposed, he being\nThe mered question. ’Twas a shame no less\nThan was his loss, to course your flying flags\nAnd leave his navy gazing.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPrithee, peace.\n\n Enter the Ambassador with Antony.\n\nANTONY.\nIs that his answer?\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nAy, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nThe Queen shall then have courtesy, so she\nWill yield us up.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nHe says so.\n\nANTONY.\nLet her know’t.—\nTo the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\nAnd he will fill thy wishes to the brim\nWith principalities.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat head, my lord?\n\nANTONY.\nTo him again. Tell him he wears the rose\nOf youth upon him, from which the world should note\nSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,\nMay be a coward’s; whose ministers would prevail\nUnder the service of a child as soon\nAs i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him therefore\nTo lay his gay comparisons apart,\nAnd answer me declined, sword against sword,\nOurselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.\n\n [_Exeunt Antony and Ambassador._]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYes, like enough high-battled Caesar will\nUnstate his happiness, and be staged to th’ show\nAgainst a sworder! I see men’s judgments are\nA parcel of their fortunes, and things outward\nDo draw the inward quality after them\nTo suffer all alike. That he should dream,\nKnowing all measures, the full Caesar will\nAnswer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued\nHis judgment too.\n\n Enter a Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nA messenger from Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, no more ceremony? See, my women,\nAgainst the blown rose may they stop their nose\nThat kneeled unto the buds. Admit him, sir.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside_.] Mine honesty and I begin to square.\nThe loyalty well held to fools does make\nOur faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure\nTo follow with allegiance a fallen lord\nDoes conquer him that did his master conquer,\nAnd earns a place i’ th’ story.\n\n Enter Thidias.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCaesar’s will?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nHear it apart.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNone but friends. Say boldly.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nSo haply are they friends to Antony.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHe needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,\nOr needs not us. If Caesar please, our master\nWill leap to be his friend. For us, you know\nWhose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nSo.—\nThus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats\nNot to consider in what case thou stand’st\nFurther than he is Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGo on; right royal.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nHe knows that you embrace not Antony\nAs you did love, but as you feared him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO!\n\nTHIDIAS.\nThe scars upon your honour, therefore, he\nDoes pity as constrained blemishes,\nNot as deserved.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe is a god and knows\nWhat is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,\nBut conquered merely.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside_.] To be sure of that,\nI will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky\nThat we must leave thee to thy sinking, for\nThy dearest quit thee.\n\n [_Exit Enobarbus._]\n\nTHIDIAS.\nShall I say to Caesar\nWhat you require of him? For he partly begs\nTo be desired to give. It much would please him\nThat of his fortunes you should make a staff\nTo lean upon. But it would warm his spirits\nTo hear from me you had left Antony,\nAnd put yourself under his shroud,\nThe universal landlord.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat’s your name?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nMy name is Thidias.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMost kind messenger,\nSay to great Caesar this in deputation:\nI kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am prompt\nTo lay my crown at’s feet, and there to kneel.\nTell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear\nThe doom of Egypt.\n\nTHIDIAS.\n’Tis your noblest course.\nWisdom and fortune combating together,\nIf that the former dare but what it can,\nNo chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay\nMy duty on your hand.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYour Caesar’s father oft,\nWhen he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,\nBestowed his lips on that unworthy place\nAs it rained kisses.\n\n Enter Antony and Enobarbus.\n\nANTONY.\nFavours, by Jove that thunders!\nWhat art thou, fellow?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nOne that but performs\nThe bidding of the fullest man and worthiest\nTo have command obeyed.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside_.] You will be whipped.\n\nANTONY.\nApproach there.—Ah, you kite!—Now, gods and devils,\nAuthority melts from me. Of late when I cried “Ho!”\nLike boys unto a muss, kings would start forth\nAnd cry “Your will?” Have you no ears? I am\nAntony yet.\n\n Enter Servants.\n\nTake hence this jack and whip him.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp\nThan with an old one dying.\n\nANTONY.\nMoon and stars!\nWhip him. Were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries\nThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\nSo saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name\nSince she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\nTill like a boy you see him cringe his face\nAnd whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nMark Antony—\n\nANTONY.\nTug him away. Being whipp’d,\nBring him again. This jack of Caesar’s shall\nBear us an errand to him.\n\n [_Exeunt Servants with Thidias._]\n\nYou were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!\nHave I my pillow left unpressed in Rome,\nForborne the getting of a lawful race,\nAnd by a gem of women, to be abused\nBy one that looks on feeders?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGood my lord—\n\nANTONY.\nYou have been a boggler ever.\nBut when we in our viciousness grow hard—\nO misery on’t!—the wise gods seal our eyes,\nIn our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us\nAdore our errors, laugh at’s while we strut\nTo our confusion.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, is’t come to this?\n\nANTONY.\nI found you as a morsel cold upon\nDead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment\nOf Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours,\nUnregistered in vulgar fame, you have\nLuxuriously pick’d out. For I am sure,\nThough you can guess what temperance should be,\nYou know not what it is.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWherefore is this?\n\nANTONY.\nTo let a fellow that will take rewards\nAnd say “God quit you!” be familiar with\nMy playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal\nAnd plighter of high hearts! O that I were\nUpon the hill of Basan, to outroar\nThe horned herd! For I have savage cause,\nAnd to proclaim it civilly were like\nA haltered neck which does the hangman thank\nFor being yare about him.\n\n Enter a Servant with Thidias.\n\nIs he whipped?\n\nSERVANT.\nSoundly, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nCried he? And begged he pardon?\n\nSERVANT.\nHe did ask favour.\n\nANTONY.\nIf that thy father live, let him repent\nThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\nTo follow Caesar in his triumph, since\nThou hast been whipped for following him. Henceforth\nThe white hand of a lady fever thee;\nShake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar;\nTell him thy entertainment. Look thou say\nHe makes me angry with him; for he seems\nProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\nNot what he knew I was. He makes me angry,\nAnd at this time most easy ’tis to do’t,\nWhen my good stars that were my former guides\nHave empty left their orbs and shot their fires\nInto th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike\nMy speech and what is done, tell him he has\nHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\nHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,\nAs he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.\nHence with thy stripes, be gone.\n\n [_Exit Thidias._]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHave you done yet?\n\nANTONY.\nAlack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed,\nAnd it portends alone the fall of Antony.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI must stay his time.\n\nANTONY.\nTo flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\nWith one that ties his points?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNot know me yet?\n\nANTONY.\nCold-hearted toward me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAh, dear, if I be so,\nFrom my cold heart let heaven engender hail\nAnd poison it in the source, and the first stone\nDrop in my neck; as it determines, so\nDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,\nTill, by degrees the memory of my womb,\nTogether with my brave Egyptians all,\nBy the discandying of this pelleted storm,\nLie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile\nHave buried them for prey!\n\nANTONY.\nI am satisfied.\nCaesar sits down in Alexandria, where\nI will oppose his fate. Our force by land\nHath nobly held; our severed navy too\nHave knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sea-like.\nWhere hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\nIf from the field I shall return once more\nTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.\nI and my sword will earn our chronicle.\nThere’s hope in’t yet.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat’s my brave lord!\n\nANTONY.\nI will be treble-sinewed, hearted, breathed,\nAnd fight maliciously. For when mine hours\nWere nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\nOf me for jests. But now I’ll set my teeth\nAnd send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\nLet’s have one other gaudy night. Call to me\nAll my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more\nLet’s mock the midnight bell.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIt is my birthday.\nI had thought t’have held it poor, but since my lord\nIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.\n\nANTONY.\nWe will yet do well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCall all his noble captains to my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nDo so; we’ll speak to them; and tonight I’ll force\nThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,\nThere’s sap in’t yet. The next time I do fight\nI’ll make Death love me, for I will contend\nEven with his pestilent scythe.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Enobarbus._]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNow he’ll outstare the lightning. To be furious\nIs to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood\nThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see still\nA diminution in our captain’s brain\nRestores his heart. When valour preys on reason,\nIt eats the sword it fights with. I will seek\nSome way to leave him.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nSCENE I. Caesar’s Camp at Alexandria.\n\n Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Maecenas, with his army.\nCaesar reading a letter.\n\nCAESAR.\nHe calls me boy, and chides as he had power\nTo beat me out of Egypt. My messenger\nHe hath whipped with rods; dares me to personal combat,\nCaesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know\nI have many other ways to die; meantime\nLaugh at his challenge.\n\nMAECENAS.\nCaesar must think,\nWhen one so great begins to rage, he’s hunted\nEven to falling. Give him no breath, but now\nMake boot of his distraction. \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra21\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003eNever\u003c/span\u003e anger\nMade good guard for itself.\n\nCAESAR.\nLet our best heads\nKnow that tomorrow the last of many battles\nWe mean to fight.

Poor Antony!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\n\n Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas with\n others.\n\nANTONY.\nHe will not fight with me, Domitius?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo.\n\nANTONY.\nWhy should he not?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHe thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,\nHe is twenty men to one.\n\nANTONY.\nTomorrow, soldier,\nBy sea and land I’ll fight. Or I will live,\nOr bathe my dying honour in the blood\nShall make it live again. Woo’t thou fight well?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI’ll strike, and cry “Take all.”\n\nANTONY.\nWell said. Come on.\nCall forth my household servants. Let’s tonight\nBe bounteous at our meal.—\n\n Enter Servants.\n\nGive me thy hand.\nThou has been rightly honest; so hast thou,\nThou, and thou, and thou. You have served me well,\nAnd kings have been your fellows.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\n[_Aside to Enobarbus_.] What means this?\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside to Cleopatra_.] ’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow\nshoots\nOut of the mind.\n\nANTONY.\nAnd thou art honest too.\nI wish I could be made so many men,\nAnd all of you clapped up together in\nAn Antony, that I might do you service\nSo good as you have done.\n\nALL THE SERVANTS.\nThe gods forbid!\n\nANTONY.\nWell, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.\nScant not my cups, and make as much of me\nAs when mine empire was your fellow too\nAnd suffered my command.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\n[_Aside to Enobarbus_.] What does he mean?\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[_Aside to Cleopatra_.] To make his followers weep.\n\nANTONY.\nTend me tonight;\nMay be it is the period of your duty.\nHaply you shall not see me more, or if,\nA mangled shadow. Perchance tomorrow\nYou’ll serve another master. I look on you\nAs one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,\nI turn you not away, but, like a master\nMarried to your good service, stay till death.\nTend me tonight two hours, I ask no more,\nAnd the gods yield you for’t!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat mean you, sir,\nTo give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,\nAnd I, an ass, am onion-eyed. For shame,\nTransform us not to women.\n\nANTONY.\nHo, ho, ho!\nNow the witch take me if I meant it thus!\nGrace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,\nYou take me in too dolorous a sense,\nFor I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you\nTo burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,\nI hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you\nWhere rather I’ll expect victorious life\nThan death and honour. Let’s to supper, come,\nAnd drown consideration.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Alexandria. Before the Palace.\n\n Enter a Company of Soldiers.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nBrother, good night.

I have yet\nRoom for six scotches more.\n\n Enter Eros.\n\nEROS.\nThey are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves\nFor a fair victory.\n\nSCARUS.\nLet us score their backs\nAnd snatch ’em up as we take hares, behind.\n’Tis sport to maul a runner.\n\nANTONY.\nI will reward thee\nOnce for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold\nFor thy good valour. Come thee on.\n\nSCARUS.\nI’ll halt after.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VIII. Under the Walls of Alexandria.\n\n Alarum. Enter Antony again in a march; Scarus with others.\n\nANTONY.\nWe have beat him to his camp. Run one before\nAnd let the Queen know of our gests.\nTomorrow,\nBefore the sun shall see’s, we’ll spill the blood\nThat has today escaped. I thank you all,\nFor doughty-handed are you, and have fought\nNot as you served the cause, but as’t had been\nEach man’s like mine. You have shown all Hectors.\nEnter the city, clip your wives, your friends,\nTell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears\nWash the congealment from your wounds and kiss\nThe honoured gashes whole.\n\n Enter Cleopatra.\n\n[_To Scarus_.] Give me thy hand.\nTo this great fairy I’ll commend thy acts,\nMake her thanks bless thee. O thou day o’ th’ world,\nChain mine armed neck. Leap thou, attire and all,\nThrough proof of harness to my heart, and there\nRide on the pants triumphing.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nLord of lords!\nO infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from\nThe world’s great snare uncaught?\n\nANTONY.\nMine nightingale,\nWe have beat them to their beds. What, girl! Though grey\nDo something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we\nA brain that nourishes our nerves and can\nGet goal for goal of youth. Behold this man.\nCommend unto his lips thy favouring hand.—\nKiss it, my warrior. He hath fought today\nAs if a god, in hate of mankind, had\nDestroyed in such a shape.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI’ll give thee, friend,\nAn armour all of gold. It was a king’s.\n\nANTONY.\nHe has deserved it, were it carbuncled\nLike holy Phœbus’ car. Give me thy hand.\nThrough Alexandria make a jolly march;\nBear our hacked targets like the men that owe them.\nHad our great palace the capacity\nTo camp this host, we all would sup together\nAnd drink carouses to the next day’s fate,\nWhich promises royal peril.—Trumpeters,\nWith brazen din blast you the city’s ear;\nMake mingle with our rattling tabourines,\nThat heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,\nApplauding our approach.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IX.

Hark further.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nO sovereign mistress of true melancholy,\nThe poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,\nThat life, a very rebel to my will,\nMay hang no longer on me.

O Antony!\n\n [_Dies._]\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nLet’s speak to him.\n\nSENTRY.\nLet’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nLet’s do so.

But this it is: our foot\nUpon the hills adjoining to the city\nShall stay with us—order for sea is given;\nThey have put forth the haven—\nWhere their appointment we may best discover\nAnd look on their endeavour.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XI. Another part of the Ground.\n\n Enter Caesar and his army.\n\nCAESAR.\nBut being charged, we will be still by land,\nWhich, as I take’t, we shall, for his best force\nIs forth to man his galleys. To the vales,\nAnd hold our best advantage.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XII. Another part of the Ground.\n\n Alarum afar off, as at a sea fight. Enter Antony and Scarus.\n\nANTONY.\nYet they are not joined. Where yond pine does stand\nI shall discover all. I’ll bring thee word\nStraight how ’tis like to go.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCARUS.\nSwallows have built\nIn Cleopatra’s sails their nests. The augurs\nSay they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,\nAnd dare not speak their knowledge.

Triple-turned whore! ’Tis thou\nHast sold me to this novice, and my heart\nMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;\nFor when I am revenged upon my charm,\nI have done all. Bid them all fly! Be gone!\n\n [_Exit Scarus._]\n\nO sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.\nFortune and Antony part here; even here\nDo we shake hands. All come to this! The hearts\nThat spanieled me at heels, to whom I gave\nTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets\nOn blossoming Caesar, and this pine is barked\nThat overtopped them all. Betray’d I am:\nO this false soul of Egypt! This grave charm,\nWhose eye becked forth my wars and called them home,\nWhose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,\nLike a right gypsy hath at fast and loose\nBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.\nWhat, Eros, Eros!\n\n Enter Cleopatra.\n\nAh, thou spell! Avaunt!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy is my lord enraged against his love?\n\nANTONY.\nVanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving\nAnd blemish Caesar’s triumph. Let him take thee\nAnd hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!\nFollow his chariot, like the greatest spot\nOf all thy sex; most monster-like be shown\nFor poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let\nPatient Octavia plough thy visage up\nWith her prepared nails.\n\n [_Exit Cleopatra._]\n\n’Tis well thou’rt gone,\nIf it be well to live; but better ’twere\nThou fell’st into my fury, for one death\nMight have prevented many.—Eros, ho!—\nThe shirt of Nessus is upon me.

Hence, Mardian,\nAnd bring me how he takes my death.—To th’ monument!\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE XIV. Alexandria. Another Room.\n\n Enter Antony and Eros.\n\nANTONY.\nEros, thou yet behold’st me?\n\nEROS.\nAy, noble lord.\n\nANTONY.\nSometime we see a cloud that’s dragonish,\nA vapour sometime like a bear or lion,\nA towered citadel, a pendant rock,\nA forked mountain, or blue promontory\nWith trees upon’t, that nod unto the world\nAnd mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs.\nThey are black vesper’s pageants.\n\nEROS.\nAy, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nThat which is now a horse, even with a thought\nThe rack dislimns and makes it indistinct\nAs water is in water.\n\nEROS.\nIt does, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nMy good knave Eros, now thy captain is\nEven such a body. Here I am Antony,\nYet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.\nI made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,\nWhose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,\nWhich, whilst it was mine, had annexed unto’t\nA million more, now lost—she, Eros, has\nPacked cards with Caesar, and false-played my glory\nUnto an enemy’s triumph.\nNay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left us\nOurselves to end ourselves.\n\n Enter Mardian.\n\nO, thy vile lady!\nShe has robbed me of my sword.\n\nMARDIAN.\nNo, Antony,\nMy mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled\nWith thine entirely.\n\nANTONY.\nHence, saucy eunuch! Peace!\nShe hath betrayed me and shall die the death.\n\nMARDIAN.\nDeath of one person can be paid but once,\nAnd that she has discharged. What thou wouldst do\nIs done unto thy hand. The last she spake\nWas “Antony! Most noble Antony!”\nThen in the midst a tearing groan did break\nThe name of Antony; it was divided\nBetween her heart and lips. She rendered life,\nThy name so buried in her.\n\nANTONY.\nDead, then?\n\nMARDIAN.\nDead.\n\nANTONY.\nUnarm, Eros. The long day’s task is done,\nAnd we must sleep.—That thou depart’st hence safe\nDoes pay thy labour richly. Go.\n\n [_Exit Mardian._]\n\nOff, pluck off!\nThe sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep\nThe battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!\nHeart, once be stronger than thy continent;\nCrack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace!\nNo more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;\nYou have been nobly borne. From me awhile.\n\n [_Exit Eros._]\n\nI will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and\nWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for now\nAll length is torture. Since the torch is out,\nLie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour\nMars what it does; yea, very force entangles\nItself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.\nEros!—I come, my queen.—Eros!—Stay for me.\nWhere souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand,\nAnd with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.\nDido and her Aeneas shall want troops,\nAnd all the haunt be ours.—Come, Eros, Eros!\n\n Enter Eros.\n\nEROS.\nWhat would my lord?\n\nANTONY.\nSince Cleopatra died,\nI have lived in such dishonour that the gods\nDetest my baseness. I, that with my sword\nQuartered the world, and o’er green Neptune’s back\nWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lack\nThe courage of a woman; less noble mind\nThan she which, by her death, our Caesar tells\n“I am conqueror of myself.” Thou art sworn, Eros,\nThat when the exigent should come, which now\nIs come indeed, when I should see behind me\nTh’ inevitable prosecution of\nDisgrace and horror, that on my command\nThou then wouldst kill me. Do’t. The time is come.\nThou strik’st not me; ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.\nPut colour in thy cheek.\n\nEROS.\nThe gods withhold me!\nShall I do that which all the Parthian darts,\nThough enemy, lost aim and could not?\n\nANTONY.\nEros,\nWouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see\nThy master thus with pleached arms, bending down\nHis corrigible neck, his face subdued\nTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat\nOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded\nHis baseness that ensued?\n\nEROS.\nI would not see’t.\n\nANTONY.\nCome, then, for with a wound I must be cured.\nDraw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn\nMost useful for thy country.\n\nEROS.\nO, sir, pardon me!\n\nANTONY.\nWhen I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then\nTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,\nOr thy precedent services are all\nBut accidents unpurposed.

Shall I strike now?\n\nANTONY.\nNow, Eros.\n\nEROS.\nWhy, there then! [_kills himself_]\nThus do I escape the sorrow\nOf Antony’s death.\n\n [_Dies._]\n\nANTONY.\nThrice nobler than myself!\nThou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what\nI should and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros\nHave by their brave instruction got upon me\nA nobleness in record. But I will be\nA bridegroom in my death and run into’t\nAs to a lover’s bed. Come then, and, Eros,\nThy master dies thy scholar. To do thus\n\n [_Falling on his sword._]\n\nI learned of thee. How? Not dead? Not dead?\nThe guard, ho! O, dispatch me!\n\n Enter a company of the Guard, one of them Dercetus.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWhat’s the noise?\n\nANTONY.\nI have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end\nOf what I have begun.\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nThe star is fallen.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nAnd time is at his period.\n\nALL.\nAlas, and woe!\n\nANTONY.\nLet him that loves me strike me dead.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nNot I.\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nNor I.\n\nTHIRD GUARD.\nNor anyone.\n\n [_Exeunt guard._]\n\nDERCETUS.\nThy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.\nThis sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings,\nShall enter me with him.\n\n Enter Diomedes.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nWhere’s Antony?\n\nDERCETUS.\nThere, Diomed, there.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nLives he? Wilt thou not answer, man?\n\n [_Exit Dercetus._]\n\nANTONY.\nArt thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me\nSufficing strokes for death.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nMost absolute lord,\nMy mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.\n\nANTONY.\nWhen did she send thee?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nNow, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere is she?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nLocked in her monument. She had a prophesying fear\nOf what hath come to pass. For when she saw—\nWhich \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra25\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e shall be found—you did suspect\nShe had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage\nWould not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;\nBut fearing since how it might work, hath sent\nMe to proclaim the truth, and I am come,\nI dread, too late.\n\nANTONY.\nToo late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nWhat, ho! The emperor’s guard! The guard, what ho!\nCome, your lord calls!\n\n Enter four or five of the Guard of Antony.\n\nANTONY.\nBear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.\n’Tis the last service that I shall command you.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWoe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear\nAll your true followers out.\n\nALL.\nMost heavy day!\n\nANTONY.\nNay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate\nTo grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome\nWhich comes to punish us, and we punish it,\nSeeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.\nI have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,\nAnd have my thanks for all.\n\n [_Exeunt, bearing Antony._]\n\nSCENE XV. Alexandria.

Our size of sorrow,\nProportioned to our cause, must be as great\nAs that which makes it.\n\n Enter, below Diomedes.\n\nHow now! Is he dead?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nHis death’s upon him, but not dead.\nLook out o’ th’ other side your monument;\nHis guard have brought him thither.\n\n Enter, below Antony borne by the Guard.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO sun,\nBurn the great sphere thou mov’st in!

Only\nI here importune death awhile until\nOf many thousand kisses the poor last\nI lay upon thy lips.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI dare not, dear\nDear my lord, pardon. I dare not,\nLest I be taken. Not th’ imperious show\nOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall\nBe brooched with me; if knife, drugs, serpents, have\nEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe.\nYour wife Octavia, with her modest eyes\nAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honour\nDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony—\nHelp me, my women—we must draw thee up.\nAssist, good friends.\n\nANTONY.\nO, quick, or I am gone.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHere’s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!\nOur strength is all gone into heaviness;\nThat makes the weight. Had I great Juno’s power,\nThe strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up\nAnd set thee by Jove’s side. Yet come a little;\nWishers were ever fools. O come, come come,\n\n [_They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra._]\n\nAnd welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast lived;\nQuicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,\nThus would I wear them out.\n\nALL.\nA heavy sight!\n\nANTONY.\nI am dying, Egypt, dying.\nGive me some wine, and let me speak a little.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNo, let me speak, and let me rail so high\nThat the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,\nProvoked by my offence.\n\nANTONY.\nOne word, sweet queen:\nOf Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThey do not go together.\n\nANTONY.\nGentle, hear me.\nNone about Caesar trust but Proculeius.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy resolution and my hands I’ll trust;\nNone about Caesar.\n\nANTONY.\nThe miserable change now at my end\nLament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts\nIn feeding them with those my former fortunes\nWherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world,\nThe noblest; and do now not basely die,\nNot cowardly put off my helmet to\nMy countryman; a Roman by a Roman\nValiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going;\nI can no more.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNoblest of men, woo’t die?\nHast thou no care of me? Shall I abide\nIn this dull world, which in thy absence is\nNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,\n\n [_ Antony dies._]\n\nThe crown o’ th’ earth doth melt.—My lord!\nO, withered is the garland of the war,\nThe soldier’s pole is fallen; young boys and girls\nAre level now with men.

It were for me\nTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods,\nTo tell them that this world did equal theirs\nTill they had stolen our jewel. All’s but naught;\nPatience is sottish, and impatience does\nBecome a dog that’s mad. Then is it sin\nTo rush into the secret house of death\nEre death dare come to us? How do you, women?\nWhat, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian?\nMy noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look,\nOur lamp is spent, it’s out! Good sirs, take heart.\nWe’ll bury him; and then, what’s brave, what’s noble,\nLet’s do it after the high Roman fashion\nAnd make death proud to take us.

And what art thou that dar’st\nAppear thus to us?\n\nDERCETUS.\nI am called Dercetus.\nMark Antony I served, who best was worthy\nBest to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,\nHe was my master, and I wore my life\nTo spend upon his haters. If thou please\nTo take me to thee, as I was to him\nI’ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,\nI yield thee up my life.\n\nCAESAR.\nWhat is’t thou say’st?\n\nDERCETUS.\nI say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.\n\nCAESAR.\nThe breaking of so great a thing should make\nA greater crack. The round world\nShould have shook lions into civil streets,\nAnd citizens to their dens. The death of Antony\nIs not a single doom; in the name lay\nA moiety of the world.\n\nDERCETUS.\nHe is dead, Caesar,\nNot by a public minister of justice,\nNor by a hired knife, but that self hand\nWhich writ his honour in the acts it did\nHath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,\nSplitted the heart. This is his sword.\nI robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained\nWith his most noble blood.\n\nCAESAR.\nLook you sad, friends?\nThe gods rebuke me, but it is tidings\nTo wash the eyes of kings.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nAnd strange it is\nThat nature must compel us to lament\nOur most persisted deeds.\n\nMAECENAS.\nHis taints and honours\nWaged equal with him.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nA rarer spirit \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra27\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nDid steer humanity, but you gods will give us\nSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.\n\nMAECENAS.\nWhen such a spacious mirror’s set before him,\nHe needs must see himself.\n\nCAESAR.\nO Antony,\nI have followed thee to this, but we do lance\nDiseases in our bodies. I must perforce\nHave shown to thee such a declining day\nOr look on thine. We could not stall together\nIn the whole world. But yet let me lament\nWith tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,\nThat thou, my brother, my competitor\nIn top of all design, my mate in empire,\nFriend and companion in the front of war,\nThe arm of mine own body, and the heart\nWhere mine his thoughts did kindle, that our stars,\nUnreconciliable, should divide\nOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends—\n\n Enter an Egyptian.\n\nBut I will tell you at some meeter season.\nThe business of this man looks out of him;\nWe’ll hear him what he says. Whence are you?\n\nEGYPTIAN.\nA poor Egyptian yet. The queen, my mistress,\nConfined in all she has, her monument,\nOf thy intents desires instruction,\nThat she preparedly may frame herself\nTo the way she’s forced to.\n\nCAESAR.\nBid her have good heart.\nShe soon shall know of us, by some of ours,\nHow honourable and how kindly we\nDetermine for her. For Caesar cannot lean\nTo be ungentle.\n\nEGYPTIAN.\nSo the gods preserve thee!\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCAESAR.\nCome hither, Proculeius. Go and say\nWe purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts\nThe quality of her passion shall require,\nLest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke\nShe do defeat us, for her life in Rome\nWould be eternal in our triumph. Go,\nAnd with your speediest bring us what she says\nAnd how you find of her.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCaesar, I shall.\n\n [_Exit Proculeius._]\n\nCAESAR.\nGallus, go you along.\n\n [_Exit Gallus._]\n\nWhere’s Dolabella, to second Proculeius?\n\nALL.\nDolabella!\n\nCAESAR.\nLet him alone, for I remember now\nHow he’s employed. He shall in time be ready.\nGo with me to my tent, where you shall see\nHow hardly I was drawn into this war,\nHow calm and gentle I proceeded still\nIn all my writings. Go with me and see\nWhat I can show in this.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Alexandria. A Room in the Monument.\n\n Enter Cleopatra, Charmian and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy desolation does begin to make\nA better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar;\nNot being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,\nA minister of her will. And it is great\nTo do that thing that ends all other deeds,\nWhich shackles accidents and bolts up change,\nWhich sleeps and \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra28\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e palates more the dung,\nThe beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s.\n\n Enter Proculeius.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCaesar sends greetings to the queen of Egypt,\nAnd bids thee study on what fair demands\nThou mean’st to have him grant thee.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat’s thy name?\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nMy name is Proculeius.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAntony\nDid tell me of you, bade me trust you, but\nI do not greatly care to be deceived\nThat have no use for trusting. If your master\nWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him\nThat majesty, to keep decorum, must\nNo less beg than a kingdom. If he please\nTo give me conquered Egypt for my son,\nHe gives me so much of mine own as I\nWill kneel to him with thanks.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nBe of good cheer.\nYou are fallen into a princely hand; fear nothing.\nMake your full reference freely to my lord,\nWho is so full of grace that it flows over\nOn all that need. Let me report to him\nYour sweet dependency, and you shall find\nA conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness\nWhere he for grace is kneeled to.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPray you tell him\nI am his fortune’s vassal and I send him\nThe greatness he has got. I hourly learn\nA doctrine of obedience, and would gladly\nLook him i’ th’ face.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nThis I’ll report, dear lady.\nHave comfort, for I know your plight is pitied\nOf him that caused it.\n\n Enter Gallus and Roman Soldiers.\n\nYou see how easily she may be surprised.\nGuard her till Caesar come.\n\nIRAS.\nRoyal queen!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nQuick, quick, good hands.\n\n [_Drawing a dagger._]\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nHold, worthy lady, hold!\n\n [_Seizes and disarms her._]\n\nDo not yourself such wrong, who are in this\nRelieved, but not betrayed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, of death too,\nThat rids our dogs of languish?\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCleopatra,\nDo not abuse my master’s bounty by\nTh’ undoing of yourself. Let the world see\nHis nobleness well acted, which your death\nWill \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra29\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e let come forth.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere art thou, Death?\nCome hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen\nWorth many babes and beggars!\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nO, temperance, lady!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSir, I will eat no meat; I’ll not drink, sir;\nIf idle talk will once be necessary,\nI’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin,\nDo Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\nWill not wait pinioned at your master’s court,\nNor once be chastised with the sober eye\nOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up\nAnd show me to the shouting varletry\nOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\nBe gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus’ mud\nLay me stark-naked, and let the water-flies\nBlow me into abhorring! Rather make\nMy country’s high pyramides my gibbet\nAnd hang me up in chains!\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nYou do extend\nThese thoughts of horror further than you shall\nFind cause in Caesar.\n\n Enter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nProculeius,\nWhat thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,\nAnd he hath sent for thee. For the queen,\nI’ll take her to my guard.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nSo, Dolabella,\nIt shall content me best. Be gentle to her.\n[_To Cleopatra._] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,\nIf you’ll employ me to him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSay I would die.\n\n [_Exeunt Proculeius and Soldiers._]\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMost noble empress, you have heard of me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI cannot tell.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nAssuredly you know me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNo matter, sir, what I have heard or known.\nYou laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;\nIs’t not your trick?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI understand not, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI dreamt there was an Emperor Antony.\nO, such another sleep, that I might see\nBut such another man!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nIf it might please you—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHis face was as the heavens, and therein stuck\nA sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted\nThe little O, the earth.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMost sovereign creature—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHis legs bestrid the ocean; his reared arm\nCrested the world; his voice was propertied\nAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\nBut when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\nHe was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\nThere was no winter in’t; an autumn ’twas\nThat grew the more by reaping. His delights\nWere dolphin-like; they showed his back above\nThe element they lived in. In his livery\nWalked crowns and crownets; realms and islands were\nAs plates dropped from his pocket.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCleopatra—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThink you there was or might be such a man\nAs this I dreamt of?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nGentle madam, no.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYou lie up to the hearing of the gods!\nBut if there be nor ever were one such,\nIt’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff\nTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet t’ imagine\nAn Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,\nCondemning shadows quite.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHear me, good madam.\nYour loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it\nAs answering to the weight. Would I might \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra30\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e\nO’ertake pursued success, but I do feel,\nBy the rebound of yours, a grief that smites\nMy very heart at root.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI thank you, sir.\nKnow you what Caesar means to do with me?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI am loath to tell you what I would you knew.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, pray you, sir.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nThough he be honourable—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe’ll lead me, then, in triumph.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMadam, he will. I know it.\n\n Flourish. Enter Caesar, Proculeius, Gallus, Maecenas and others of his\n train.\n\nALL.\nMake way there! Caesar!\n\nCAESAR.\nWhich is the Queen of Egypt?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nIt is the Emperor, madam.\n\n [_Cleopatra kneels._]\n\nCAESAR.\nArise, you shall not kneel.\nI pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSir, the gods\nWill have it thus. My master and my lord\nI must obey.\n\nCAESAR.\nTake to you no hard thoughts.\nThe record of what injuries you did us,\nThough written in our flesh, we shall remember\nAs things but done by chance.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSole sir o’ th’ world,\nI cannot project mine own cause so well\nTo make it clear, but do confess I have\nBeen laden with like frailties which before\nHave often shamed our sex.\n\nCAESAR.\nCleopatra, know\nWe will extenuate rather than enforce.\nIf you apply yourself to our intents,\nWhich towards you are most gentle, you shall find\nA benefit in this change; but if you seek\nTo lay on me a cruelty by taking\nAntony’s course, you shall bereave yourself\nOf my good purposes, and put your children\nTo that destruction which I’ll guard them from\nIf thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd may, through all the world. ’Tis yours, and we,\nYour scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\nHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis is the brief of money, plate, and jewels\nI am possessed of. ’Tis exactly valued,\nNot petty things admitted. Where’s Seleucus?\n\n Enter Seleucus.\n\nSELEUCUS.\nHere, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,\nUpon his peril, that I have reserved\nTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\n\nSELEUCUS.\nMadam, I had rather seal my lips\nThan to my peril speak that which is not.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat have I kept back?\n\nSELEUCUS.\nEnough to purchase what you have made known.\n\nCAESAR.\nNay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve\nYour wisdom in the deed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSee, Caesar! O, behold,\nHow pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours\nAnd should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\nThe ingratitude of this Seleucus does\nEven make me wild. O slave, of no more trust\nThan love that’s hired! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt\nGo back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes\nThough they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!\nO rarely base!\n\nCAESAR.\nGood queen, let us entreat you.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\nThat thou vouchsafing here to visit me,\nDoing the honour of thy lordliness\nTo one so meek, that mine own servant should\nParcel the sum of my disgraces by\nAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\nThat I some lady trifles have reserved,\nImmoment toys, things of such dignity\nAs we greet modern friends withal; and say\nSome nobler token I have kept apart\nFor Livia and Octavia, to induce\nTheir mediation, must I be unfolded\nWith one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me\nBeneath the fall I have.\n[_To Seleucus_.] Prithee go hence,\nOr I shall show the cinders of my spirits\nThrough th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,\nThou wouldst have mercy on me.\n\nCAESAR.\nForbear, Seleucus.\n\n [_Exit Seleucus._]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBe it known that we, the greatest, are misthought\nFor things that others do; and when we fall,\nWe answer others’ merits in our name,\nAre therefore to be pitied.\n\nCAESAR.\nCleopatra,\nNot what you have reserved nor what acknowledged\nPut we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be’t yours;\nBestow it at your pleasure, and believe\nCaesar’s no merchant to make prize with you\nOf things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheered;\nMake not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear queen;\nFor we intend so to dispose you as\nYourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.\nOur care and pity is so much upon you\nThat we remain your friend; and so, adieu.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy master and my lord!\n\nCAESAR.\nNot so. Adieu.\n\n [_Flourish. Exeunt Caesar and his train._]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\nBe noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!\n\n [_Whispers to Charmian._]\n\nIRAS.\nFinish, good lady. The bright day is done,\nAnd we are for the dark.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHie thee again.\nI have spoke already, and it is provided.\nGo put it to the haste.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam, I will.\n\n Enter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nWhere’s the Queen?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nBehold, sir.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDolabella!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMadam, as thereto sworn by your command,\nWhich my love makes religion to obey,\nI tell you this: Caesar through Syria\nIntends his journey, and within three days\nYou with your children will he send before.\nMake your best use of this. I have performed\nYour pleasure and my promise.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDolabella,\nI shall remain your debtor.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI your servant.\nAdieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFarewell, and thanks.\n\n [_Exit Dolabella._]\n\nNow, Iras, what think’st thou?\nThou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown\nIn Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves\nWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall\nUplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,\nRank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,\nAnd forced to drink their vapour.\n\nIRAS.\nThe gods forbid!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors\nWill catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers\nBallad us out o’ tune. The quick comedians\nExtemporally will stage us and present\nOur Alexandrian revels; Antony\nShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\nSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\nI’ th’ posture of a whore.\n\nIRAS.\nO the good gods!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, that’s certain.\n\nIRAS.\nI’ll \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra31\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e see’t, for I am sure mine nails\nAre stronger than mine eyes.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy, that’s the way\nTo fool their preparation and to conquer\nTheir most absurd intents.\n\n Enter Charmian.\n\nNow, Charmian!\nShow me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch\nMy best attires. I am again for Cydnus\nTo meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.\nNow, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch indeed,\nAnd when thou hast done this chare, I’ll give thee leave\nTo play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\n\n [_Exit Iras. A noise within._]\n\nWherefore’s this noise?\n\n Enter a Guardsman.\n\nGUARDSMAN.\nHere is a rural fellow\nThat will not be denied your highness’ presence.\nHe brings you figs.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nLet him come in.\n\n [_Exit Guardsman._]\n\nWhat poor an instrument\nMay do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.\nMy resolution’s placed, and I have nothing\nOf woman in me. Now from head to foot\nI am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon\nNo planet is of mine.\n\n Enter Guardsman and Clown with a basket.\n\nGUARDSMAN.\nThis is the man.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAvoid, and leave him.\n\n [_Exit Guardsman._]\n\nHast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there\nThat kills and pains not?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you\nto touch him, for his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do\nseldom or \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra32\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e recover.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nRemember’st thou any that have died on’t?\n\nCLOWN.\nVery many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than\nyesterday—a very honest woman, but something given to lie; as a woman\nshould not do but in the way of honesty—how she died of the biting of\nit, what pain she felt. Truly she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm;\nbut he that will believe all that they say shall \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra33\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e be saved by half\nthat they do. But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGet thee hence. Farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nI wish you all joy of the worm.\n\n [_Sets down the basket._]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFarewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAy, ay, farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nLook you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise\npeople; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nTake thou no care; it shall be heeded.\n\nCLOWN.\nVery good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the\nfeeding.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWill it eat me?\n\nCLOWN.\nYou must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not\neat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil\ndress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great\nharm in their women, for in every ten that they make, the devils mar\nfive.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell, get thee gone. Farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nYes, forsooth. I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n Enter Iras with a robe, crown, \u0026c.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGive me my robe. Put on my crown. I have\nImmortal longings in me. Now no more\nThe juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.\nYare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\nAntony call. I see him rouse himself\nTo praise my noble act. I hear him mock\nThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\nTo excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!\nNow to that name my courage prove my title!\nI am fire and air; my other elements\nI give to baser life.—So, have you done?\nCome then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\nFarewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.\n\n [_Kisses them. Iras falls and dies._]\n\nHave I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\nIf thou and nature can so gently part,\nThe stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,\nWhich hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?\nIf thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world\nIt is not worth leave-taking.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nDissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say\nThe gods themselves do weep!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis proves me base.\nIf she first meet the curled Antony,\nHe’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\nWhich is my heaven to have.—Come, thou mortal wretch,\n\n [_To an asp, which she applies to her breast._]\n\nWith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\nOf life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,\nBe angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,\nThat I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\nUnpolicied!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO eastern star!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPeace, peace!\nDost thou not see my baby at my breast\nThat sucks the nurse asleep?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO, break! O, break!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAs sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—\nO Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.\n\n [_Applying another asp to her arm._]\n\nWhat should I stay—\n\n [_Dies._]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIn this vile world? So, fare thee well.\nNow boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies\nA lass unparalleled. Downy windows, close,\nAnd golden Phœbus \u003cspan id=\"matchAntony and Cleopatra34\" className=\"highlight-match\"\u003enever\u003c/span\u003e be beheld\nOf eyes again so royal! Your crown’s awry;\nI’ll mend it and then play.\n\n Enter the Guard rustling in.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWhere’s the queen?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nSpeak softly. Wake her not.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nCaesar hath sent—\n\nCHARMIAN.\nToo slow a messenger.\n\n [_Applies an asp._]\n\nO, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nApproach, ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s beguiled.\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nThere’s Dolabella sent from Caesar. Call him.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWhat work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIt is well done, and fitting for a princess\nDescended of so many royal kings.\nAh, soldier!\n\n [_Charmian dies._]\n\n Enter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHow goes it here?\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nAll dead.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCaesar, thy thoughts\nTouch their effects in this. Thyself art coming\nTo see performed the dreaded act which thou\nSo sought’st to hinder.\n\n Enter Caesar and all his train, marching.\n\nALL.\nA way there, a way for Caesar!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nO sir, you are too sure an augurer:\nThat you did fear is done.\n\nCAESAR.\nBravest at the last,\nShe levelled at our purposes and, being royal,\nTook her own way. The manner of their deaths?\nI do not see them bleed.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nWho was last with them?\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nA simple countryman that brought her figs.\nThis was his basket.\n\nCAESAR.\nPoisoned then.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nO Caesar,\nThis Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.\nI found her trimming up the diadem\nOn her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,\nAnd on the sudden dropped.\n\nCAESAR.\nO noble weakness!\nIf they had swallowed poison ’twould appear\nBy external swelling; but she looks like sleep,\nAs she would catch another Antony\nIn her strong toil of grace.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHere on her breast\nThere is a vent of blood, and something blown.\nThe like is on her arm.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nThis is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves\nHave slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves\nUpon the caves of Nile.\n\nCAESAR.\nMost probable\nThat so she died, for her physician tells me\nShe hath pursued conclusions infinite\nOf easy ways to die. Take up her bed,\nAnd bear her women from the monument.\nShe shall be buried by her Antony.\nNo grave upon the earth shall clip in it\nA pair so famous. High events as these\nStrike those that make them; and their story is\nNo less in pity than his glory which\nBrought them to be lamented. Our army shall\nIn solemn show attend this funeral,\nAnd then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\nHigh order in this great solemnity.\n\n [_Exeunt omnes._]",
